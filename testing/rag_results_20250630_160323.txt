TEXT: for the perfect position---immortality. The //guru// must be competent to lead his disciple back home, back to Godhead. ===== Saints and Swindlers ===== //Every day the number of people interested in practicing yoga and meditation increases by the thousands. Unfortunately, a person looking for a suitable guide is likely to encounter a bewildering array of magicians, self-styled gurus, and self-proclaimed gods. In an interview with the London// Times, //Śrīla Prabhupāda explains how a sincere seeker can tell the difference between a counterfeit and genuine spiritual guide.// **Reporter:** What frankly worries me is that since the arrival in Britain some time ago of an Indian //yogī,// who was the first //"guru"// that most people had ever heard of, a lot of //"gurus"// have suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Sometimes I get the feeling that not all of them are as genuine as they ought to be. Would it be right to warn people who are thinking of taking up spiritual life that they should make sure that they have a genuine //guru// to teach them? **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Yes. Of course, to search out a //guru// is very nice, but if you want a cheap //guru,// or if you want to be cheated, then you will find many cheating //gurus.// But if you are sincere, you will find a sincere //guru.// Because people want everything very cheaply, they are cheated. We ask our students to refrain from illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling, and intoxication. People think that this is all very difficult---a botheration. But if someone else says, "You may do whatever nonsense you like, simply take my //mantra,//"then people will like him. The point is that people want to be cheated, and therefore cheaters come. No one wants to undergo any austerity. Human life is meant for austerity, but no one is prepared to undergo austerity. Consequently, cheaters come and say, "No austerity. Whatever you like, you do. Simply pay me, and I'll give you some //mantra,// and you'll become God in six months." All this is going on. If you want to be cheated like this, the cheaters will come. **Reporter:** What about the person who seriously wants to find spiritual life but who happens to finish up with the wrong //guru?// **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** If you simply want an ordinary education, you have to devote

TEXT: these boys going to see the cinema? Why don't they eat meat or go to the nightclub? Because their taste has changed. They hate all these things now. In this way, you make progress. First faith, then association with devotees, then removal of all misgivings, then firm faith, then taste, then God realization, and then love of God, the perfection. That is first-class religion. Not some ritualistic ceremony of "I believe, you believe." That is not religion. That is cheating. Real religion means to develop your love for God. That is the perfection of religion. **Mike Robinson:** Thank you very much for talking with me. It's been a pleasure talking to you. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Hare Kṛṣṇa. ===== Truth and Beauty ===== //Śrīla Prabhupāda first published this essay in India, in the old tabloid version of his then---fortnightly magazine Back to Godhead (November 20, 1958). It contains the unforgettable story of "liquid beauty," in which Śrīla Prabhupāda dramatically exposes the underlying principle of human sexuality. This illuminating exposition on the nature of truth and beauty is timeless and startlingly relevant for those in search of the "inner self."// There may sometimes be arguments about whether "truth" and "beauty" are compatible terms. One would willingly agree to express the truth, one might say, but since truth is not always beautiful---indeed, it is frequently rather startling and unpleasant---how is one to express truth and beauty at the same time? In reply, we may inform all concerned that "truth" and "beauty" //are// compatible terms. Indeed, we may emphatically assert that the actual truth, which is absolute, is always beautiful. The truth is so beautiful that it attracts everyone, including the truth itself. Truth is so beautiful that many sages, saints, and devotees have left everything for the sake of truth. Mahatma Gandhi, an idol of the modern world, dedicated his life to experimenting with truth, and all his activities were aimed toward truth only. Why only Mahatma Gandhi? Every one of us has the urge to search for truth alone, for the truth is not only beautiful but also all-powerful, all-resourceful, all-famous, all-renounced, and all-knowledgeable. Unfortunately, people have no information of the actual truth. Indeed, 99.9 percent of men in all walks of life are pursuing untruth only, in the name of truth. We are actually attracted by

TEXT: that everyone become Kṛṣṇa conscious by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This is practical, simple, and sublime. Four hundred and eighty years ago this formula was introduced in India by Lord Śrī Caitanya, and now it is available in your country. Take to this simple process of chanting as above mentioned, realize your factual position by reading the //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// and reestablish your lost relationship with Kṛṣṇa, God. Peace and prosperity will be the immediate worldwide result. ===== Spiritual Communism ===== In 1971, during his historic visit to the Soviet Union, Śrīla Prabhupāda was introduced to Professor Grigoriy Kotovsky, head of the India Department at the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Indian studies department at the University of Moscow. As they sat informally in Dr. Kotovsky's office, the spiritual leader and the communist scholar vigorously discussed topics of mutual concern, and Śrīla Prabhupāda proposed a radical reformation within modern communism. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** The other day I was reading the paper, //Moscow News.// There was a Communist congress, and the President declared, "We are ready to take others' experience to improve." So I think the Vedic concept of socialism or communism will much improve the idea of communism. For example, in a socialistic state the idea is that no one should starve; everyone must have his food. Similarly, in the Vedic concept of //gṛhastha// [householder] life it is recommended that a householder see that even a lizard or a snake living in his house should not starve. Even these lower creatures should be given food, and certainly all humans should. It is recommended that the //gṛhastha,// before taking his lunch, stand on the road and declare, "If anyone is still hungry, please come! Food is ready!" If there is no response, then the proprietor of the household takes his lunch. Modern society takes the people as a whole as the proprietor of a certain state, but the Vedic conception is //īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]//---everything is owned by //īśa,// the supreme controller. //Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ//---you may enjoy what is allotted to you by Him. //Mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam:// but do not encroach upon others' property. This is the //Īśopaniṣad-Veda.// The same idea is explained in the
