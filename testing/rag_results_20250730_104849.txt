### 📖 The Role of a Mahā-Bhāgavata

**Prabhupāda:** So, **mahā-bhāva**, the ecstasies, that is not to be imitated by us, but to be aware of this fact that how **mahā-bhāgavata**, **mahā-bhāva**, they treat with Kṛṣṇa. So generally, advancement, especially those who are preachers, they should remain on the second platform. Even a **mahā-bhāgavata**, when he becomes preacher, he comes down to the second platform. He does not remain on the topmost platform. He plays the part of second platform.

**Prabhupāda:** Sometimes it is stated in the Bible, I think, that Jesus Christ said, "I had many things to say, but I am not saying." Is it not? Yes. So actually, the **mahā-bhāgavata**, he has many things to say, but because he's preacher he does not say everything to the neophyte devotees. Because they are not competent to accept that.

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu... The best example is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He's Kṛṣṇa Himself, but He's playing the part of **mahā-bhāgavata**. He never discussed Kṛṣṇa's **rasa-līlā** publicly. Never discussed. You won't find any time that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is discussing **rasa-līlā** publicly. No. Never.

**Prabhupāda:** He was..., He simply dealt with ordinary persons by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa **mantra**, and whenever there were scholars, there were philosophers---just like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī---He talks with some philosophy, **Vedānta-sūtra**. And when there was high-class devotee like Rāmānanda Rāya, He discussed about Kṛṣṇa's **līlā**. You'll find this. Not that with everyone He discussed Kṛṣṇa's **līlā**. No. Neither He discussed philosophy with everyone.

**Prabhupāda:** But for the general public, so long He remained at Jagannātha Purī, every evening He was simply organizing great **saṅkīrtana** party. And for four hours, at least, He was going on **saṅkīrtana** in four parties. We have studied this thing from **Caitanya-caritāmṛta**, or **Teachings of Lord Caitanya**, that from the dealings of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, because although He's Kṛṣṇa Himself, He's playing the part of **ācārya**, playing the part of devotee.

SHLOKA:

**namo mahā-vadānyāya**  
**kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te**  
**kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-**  
**nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ**  
— *Cc. Madhya 19.53*

SHLOKA:

**Bhaktākhyaṁ bhaktāvatāraṁ namāmi bhakta-śaktikam**  
**pañca-tattvātmakaṁ kṛṣṇam**  
— *Cc. Ādi 1.14*

**Prabhupāda:** So we should follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the six Gosvāmīs, and gradually let us learn what is devotional service, how to execute it. Everything is very nicely explained in the **Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu** which we have presented herewith as **The Devo..., Nectar of Devotion**, "The Complete Science for the **Bhakti-yoga**." So first of all, we should take advantage of these **granthas**, and then gradually make progress.

**Prabhupāda:** Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore said that **kabe hāma bujhabo śrī yugala-pīriti**.

**Prabhupāda:** **rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti**  
**kabe hāma bujhabo śrī yugala-pīri...**  
**[Lālasāmayī]** Without understanding Rūpa-Raghunātha, or without going through the literatures given by Rūpa-Raghunātha, if we jumpingly, all of a sudden, try to become a devotee of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa... Of course, our aim is to become devotee of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but how to become Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa we must study these books, **Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu** especially. Thank you very much.

**Devotees:** Haribol!

*Key Insight: A mahā-bhāgavata remains on the
