### 📖 The Power of Hearing about Kṛṣṇa

**Prabhupāda:** To hear about Kṛṣṇa from Vedic literatures or to hear from Him directly through the Bhagavad-gītā is itself righteous activity. And for one who hears about Kṛṣṇa, Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is dwelling in everyone's heart, acts as a best-wishing friend and purifies the devotee who constantly engages in hearing of Him. In this way, a devotee naturally develops his dormant transcendental knowledge. 

As he hears more about Kṛṣṇa from the Bhāgavatam and from the devotees, he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. And by development of devotional service one becomes freed from the modes of passion and ignorance, and thus material lusts and avarice are diminished.

This is the process. By hearing, you become pious. Those who are hearing in this meeting, even they cannot understand the words which we are discussing, he's, he's becoming purer. He's becoming... Just like one becomes purer by acting piously. So simply hearing, if one cannot understand the whole thing, he becomes pious.

SHLOKA:

**Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ**
— *SB 1.2.17*

One who is speaking Kṛṣṇa's words and one who is hearing Kṛṣṇa's..., both of them are becoming purified. So if we hear daily, regularly, **nityam, nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā**, then...

SHLOKA:

**Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā**
**Bhagavaty uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī**
— *SB 1.2.18*

If you hear daily... Just like we are holding class daily in the morning. And **bhāgavata-sevayā**. **Sevayā** means service. To make the place nicely cleansed so that devotees will sit down and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā will be discussed, this is called **bhāgavata-sevā**, serving the Bhāgavata.

The whole difficulty is that our heart is covered with so many dirty things. So by this process, this **bhāgavata-sevayā**, the dirty things will be cleansed. Not that exactly all cleansed. Even a little portion is cleansed, **naṣṭa-prāyeṣu**, not fully cleansed, **prāyeṣu**, almost, then immediately, **bhagavaty uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī**, immediately you come to the platform of **bhakti-yoga**. Little cleansed. **Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt**.

Therefore, we sometimes see that one who has taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, still, he is committing something wrong. But that is not very..., that is not a case of discouragement. You stick to this principle. **Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā**. **Api cet su-durācāraḥ**. We should not willingly do anything wrong. But due to our past habit, if we do something wrong, that we should not be discouraged. But stick to the principle, then gradually you'll be cleansed. **Naṣṭa-prāyeṣu abhadreṣu**. **Prāyeṣu** means almost cleansed, not completely clean. So we don't claim that we have become liberated from all dirty things. There are so many dirty things still. But little clearance will help us to become a devotee of the Lord.

*Key Insight: Hearing about Kṛṣṇa cleanses the heart and brings one to the platform of bhakti-yoga.*

### 📖 The Stages of Faith

**Prabhupāda:** **Naiṣṭhikī**. This is the stage of attachment to Kṛṣṇa. **Mayy āsakta-manāḥ**. There are different stages. So this **niṣṭhā**, firm faith. First of all, loose faith. Then, as we execute devotional service, the faith becomes firmer, firmer, firmer. And when it comes to firm, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I am His eternal servant,"

*Key Insight: Devotional service strengthens faith, leading to firm attachment to Kṛṣṇa.*
