üïâ Honoring Srila Prabhupada's Guidance

As we embark on this journey to understand the essence of Krishna, let us first acknowledge the invaluable contributions of Srila Prabhupada, whose teachings continue to inspire and guide devotees worldwide.

‚ú® Who is Krishna?

According to Srila Prabhupada's teachings, **Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead**, the ultimate goal of life. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently puts it, "Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, the ultimate goal of life." [On the Way to Krsna 4, purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/owk/4.txt)

But what does this mean? It means that Krishna is not just a historical figure or a mythological character, but the very essence of existence.

As Queen Kunti so beautifully describes Him, "You are the all-attractive, all-knowing, and all-powerful Lord, and You are the supreme controller of all living entities." [Teachings of Queen Kunti 6, verse 26, translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/6.txt/)

‚ú® Reflection

In essence, Krishna is not just a name or a concept, but the very fabric of existence. He is the source of everything, the ultimate reality, and the supreme controller of all living entities. As we begin to understand this, we can start to appreciate the significance of Krishna consciousness in our lives.
