REFERENCE: Bg. 18.72 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: kaccid etac chrutaṁ pārthatvayaikāgreṇa cetasākaccid ajñāna-sammohaḥpraṇaṣṭas te dhanañ-jaya

TRANSLATION: O son of Pṛthā, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gītā in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-gītā if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gītā from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gītā is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.

REFERENCE: Bg. 18.6 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: etāny api tu karmāṇisaṅgaṁ tyaktvā phalāni cakartavyānīti me pārthaniścitaṁ matam uttamam

TRANSLATION: All these activities should be performed without attachment or any expectation of result. They should be performed as a matter of duty, O son of Pṛthā. That is My final opinion.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Although all sacrifices are purifying, one should not expect any result by such performances. In other words, all sacrifices which are meant for material advancement in life should be given up, but sacrifices that purify one’s existence and elevate one to the spiritual plane should not be stopped. Everything that leads to Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be encouraged. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted. That is the highest criterion of religion. A devotee of the Lord should accept any kind of work, sacrifice or charity which will help him in the discharge of devotional service to the Lord.

REFERENCE: Bg. 18.1 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: arjuna uvācasannyāsasya mahā-bāhotattvam icchāmi veditumtyāgasya ca hṛṣīkeśapṛthak keśi-niṣūdana

TRANSLATION: Arjuna said: O mighty-armed one, I wish to understand the purpose of renunciation [tyāga] and of the renounced order of life [sannyāsa], O killer of the Keśī demon, master of the senses.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Actually the Bhagavad-gītā is finished in seventeen chapters. The Eighteenth Chapter is a supplementary summarization of the topics discussed before. In every chapter of Bhagavad-gītā, Lord Kṛṣṇa stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life. This same point is summarized in the Eighteenth Chapter as the most confidential path of knowledge. In the first six chapters, stress was given to devotional service: yoginām api sarveṣām … “Of all yogīs or transcendentalists, one who always thinks of Me within himself is best.” In the next six chapters, pure devotional service and its nature and activity were discussed. In the third six chapters, knowledge, renunciation, the activities of material nature and transcendental nature, and devotional service were described. It was concluded that all acts should be performed in conjunction with the Supreme Lord, represented by the words oṁ tat sat, which indicate Viṣṇu, the Supreme Person. The third part of Bhagavad-gītā has shown that devotional service, and nothing else, is the ultimate purpose of life. This has been established by citing past ācāryas and the Brahma-sūtra, the Vedānta-sūtra. Certain impersonalists consider themselves to have a monopoly on the knowledge of Vedānta-sūtra, but actually the Vedānta-sūtra is meant for understanding devotional service, for the Lord Himself is the composer of the Vedānta-sūtra, and He is its knower. That is described in the Fifteenth Chapter. In every scripture, every Veda, devotional service is the objective. That is explained in Bhagavad-gītā.

As in the Second Chapter a synopsis of the whole subject matter was described, in the Eighteenth Chapter also the summary of all instruction is given. The purpose of life is indicated to be renunciation and attainment of the transcendental position above the three material modes of nature. Arjuna wants to clarify the two distinct subject matters of Bhagavad-gītā, namely renunciation (tyāga) and the renounced order of life (sannyāsa). Thus he is asking the meaning of these two words.

Two words used in this verse to address the Supreme Lord – Hṛṣīkeśa and Keśi-niṣūdana – are significant. Hṛṣīkeśa is Kṛṣṇa, the master of all senses, who can always help us attain mental serenity. Arjuna requests Him to summarize everything in such a way that he can remain equipoised. Yet he has some doubts, and doubts are always compared to demons. He therefore addresses Kṛṣṇa as Keśi-niṣūdana. Keśī was a most formidable demon who was killed by the Lord; now Arjuna is expecting Kṛṣṇa to kill the demon of doubt.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🕉 Srila Prabhupada's Gift: The Bhagavad Gita

My dear devotee, let us begin by acknowledging the immense contribution of Srila Prabhupada to the spiritual world. His teachings on the Bhagavad Gita are a treasure trove of spiritual knowledge, and today, we'll explore why preaching this sacred text is the highest welfare work.

✨ The Bhagavad Gita: A Divine Revelation

The Bhagavad Gita is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. [Bg. 18.72, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/72.txt) This divine revelation has the power to dispel our ignorance and guide us on the path of self-realization. As Srila Prabhupada says, "Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gītā from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled." [Bg. 18.72, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/72.txt)

✨ The Ultimate Goal of Life

So, what is the ultimate goal of life? Srila Prabhupada reminds us that "in every chapter of Bhagavad-gītā, Lord Kṛṣṇa stresses that devotional service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal of life." [Bg. 18.1, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/1.txt) This devotional service is not just a means to an end, but the very purpose of our existence.

✨ Preaching Bhagavad Gita: The Highest Welfare Work

Now, let's explore why preaching the Bhagavad Gita is considered the highest welfare work. Srila Prabhupada explains that "everything that leads to Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be encouraged. In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam also it is said that any activity which leads to devotional service to the Lord should be accepted." [Bg. 18.6, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/6.txt) By sharing the Bhagavad Gita with others, we are not only helping them to dispel their ignorance but also encouraging them to take up devotional service, the ultimate goal of life.

✨ Reflection and Action

As we reflect on the importance of preaching the Bhagavad Gita, let us ask ourselves: "What can I do to share this divine knowledge with others?" Perhaps we can start by sharing a verse or two with a friend or family member, or by participating in a Bhagavad Gita study
