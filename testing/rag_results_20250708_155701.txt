REFERENCE: Bg. 4.5 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: śrī-bhagavān uvācabahūni me vyatītānijanmāni tava cārjunatāny ahaṁ veda sarvāṇina tvaṁ vettha paran-tapa

TRANSLATION: The Personality of Godhead said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: In the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:

In the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:

advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpamādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ cavedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktaugovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.”

It is also stated in Brahma-saṁhitā (5.39):

It is also stated in Brahma-saṁhitā (5.39):

rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhannānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintukṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yogovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also.”

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also.”

In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidūrya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas (vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to the sun-god Vivasvān, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the Gītā cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kṛṣṇa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-ānanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit – whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Session Title:** The Supreme Lord Krsna: Understanding His Divine Nature

**Gita Reference:** Bhagavad-gita, Chapter 4, Verse 5

Welcome, dear devotees, to this session where we'll delve into the sublime nature of the Supreme Lord Krsna. As we explore His divine characteristics, we'll gain a deeper understanding of His absolute position and our relationship with Him.

**Opening Hook:** Let's begin with a powerful statement from Srila Prabhupada: "I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning." [Bg. 4.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt) This quote sets the tone for our discussion, highlighting Krsna's unique position as the original, absolute, and infallible Personality of Godhead.

**Core Teaching:** In Bhagavad-gita, Chapter 4, Verse 5, Krsna reveals His divine nature to Arjuna: "Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!" [Bg. 4.5](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt) This verse showcases Krsna's extraordinary abilities, which are beyond human comprehension. He has undergone countless incarnations, and yet, He remembers each and every one of them.

**Frameworks or Levels:** To better understand Krsna's nature, let's examine three key aspects: advaita, infallibility, and His absolute position.

* **Advaita:** Krsna is advaita, meaning there is no distinction between His body and Himself. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit – whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body." [Bg. 4.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt) This concept is difficult for us to grasp, as we're accustomed to distinguishing between our bodies and our selves. However, Krsna's advaita nature underscores His divine, spiritual essence.
* **Infallibility:** Krsna is infallible, meaning He never forgets Himself, even in material contact. Srila Prabhupada elaborates, "The Lord is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact." [Bg. 4.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt) This characteristic highlights Krsna's unwavering self-awareness and His ability to remain unaffected by the material world.
* **Absolute Position:** Krsna's absolute position is reinforced by His statement, "I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning." [Bg. 4.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt) This quote emphasizes Krsna's original, absolute, and infallible nature, which is beyond human comprehension.

**Practical Application:** As we reflect on Krsna's divine nature, let's consider the following questions:

* How can I deepen my understanding of Krsna's absolute position and His relationship with me?
* In what ways can I cultivate a sense of reverence and awe for Krsna's infallible and advaita nature?
* How can I apply the principles of Krsna's divine nature to my daily life, recognizing His presence in every aspect of existence?

**Micro-practice:** Take a few moments each day to contemplate Krsna's divine nature. Repeat the following mantra to yourself: "Krsna is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning." As you reflect on this mantra, try to internalize its meaning, and allow it to guide your thoughts and actions throughout the day.

**Closing Reflection:** As we conclude this session, let's remember Srila Prabhupada's words: "I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning." [Bg. 4.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt) May we continue to glorify the Supreme Lord Krsna, recognizing His divine nature and our eternal relationship with Him.

**Key Quotes:**

* "Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!" [Bg. 4.5](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/4/5.txt)

**Summary:** In this session, we explored the divine nature of the Supreme Lord Krsna, examining His absolute position, infallibility, and advaita nature. By internalizing these concepts, we can deepen our understanding of Krsna's relationship with us and cultivate a sense of reverence and awe for His divine nature.
