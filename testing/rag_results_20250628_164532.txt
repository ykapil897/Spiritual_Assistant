TRANSLATION: ≈örƒ´ NƒÅrada said: You have not actually broadcast the sublime and spotless glories of the Personality of Godhead. That philosophy which does not satisfy the transcendental senses of the Lord is considered worthless.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The eternal relation of an individual soul with the Supreme Soul Personality of Godhead is constitutionally one of being the eternal servitor of the eternal master. The Lord has expanded Himself as living beings in order to accept loving service from them, and this alone can satisfy both the Lord and the living beings. Such a scholar as VyƒÅsadeva has completed many expansions of the Vedic literatures, ending with the VedƒÅnta philosophy, but none of them have been written directly glorifying the Personality of Godhead. Dry philosophical speculations even on the transcendental subject of the Absolute have very little attraction without directly dealing with the glorification of the Lord. The Personality of Godhead is the last word in transcendental realization. The Absolute realized as impersonal Brahman or localized Supersoul, ParamƒÅtmƒÅ, is less productive of transcendental bliss than the supreme personal realization of His glories.

The compiler of the //VedƒÅnta-dar≈õana// is VyƒÅsadeva himself. Yet he is troubled, although he is the author. So what sort of transcendental bliss can be derived by the readers and listeners of VedƒÅnta which is not explained directly by VyƒÅsadeva, the author? Herein arises the necessity of explaining //VedƒÅnta-s≈´tra// in the form of //≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam// by the self-same author.

REFERENCE: SB 4.31.13 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Factually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the original source of all self-realization. Consequently, the goal of all auspicious activities---karma, j√±ƒÅna, yoga and bhakti---is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The living entity is the marginal energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the material world is the external energy. Under the circumstances, one must understand that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is factually the original source of both matter and spirit. This is explained in the Seventh Chapter of //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ// [[books:bg:7:4|(7.4-5)]]:

> bh≈´mir ƒÅpo 'nalo vƒÅyu·∏•
> kha·πÅ mano buddhir eva ca
> aha·πÖkƒÅra itƒ´ya·πÅ me
> bhinnƒÅ prak·πõtir a·π£·π≠adhƒÅ
>
> apareyam itas tv anyƒÅ·πÅ
> prak·πõti·πÅ viddhi me parƒÅm
> jƒ´va-bh≈´tƒÅ·πÅ mahƒÅ-bƒÅho
> yayeda·πÅ dhƒÅryate jagat

"Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego---all together these eight comprise My separated material energies. But besides this inferior nature, O mighty-armed Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which consists of all living entities who are struggling with material nature and are sustaining the universe."

The entire cosmic manifestation is but a combination of matter and spirit. The spiritual part is the living entity, and these living entities are described as //prak·πõti,// or energy. The living entity is never described as //puru·π£a,// the Supreme Person; therefore to identify the living entity with the Supreme Lord is simply ignorance. The living entity is the marginal potency of the Supreme Lord, although there is factually no difference between the energy and the energetic. The duty of the living entity is to understand his real identity. When he does, K·πõ·π£·πáa gives him all the facilities to come to the platform of devotional service. That is the perfection of life. This is indicated in the Vedic //Upani·π£ad://

> yam evai·π£a v·πõ·πáute tena labhyas
> tasyai·π£a ƒÅtmƒÅ viv·πõ·πáute tan≈´·πÅ svƒÅm

Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa confirms this in //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ// [[books:bg:10:10|(Bg. 10.10)]]:

> te·π£ƒÅ·πÅ satata-yuktƒÅnƒÅ·πÅ
> bhajatƒÅ·πÅ prƒ´ti-p≈´rvakam
> dadƒÅmi buddhi-yoga·πÅ ta·πÅ
> yena mƒÅm upayƒÅnti te

"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me." The conclusion is that one must come to the platform of //bhakti-yoga,// even though one may begin with //karma-yoga, j√±ƒÅna-yoga// or //a·π£·π≠ƒÅ·πÖga-yoga.// Unless one comes to the platform of //bhakti-yoga,// self-realization or realization of the Absolute Truth cannot be achieved.

REFERENCE: SB 3.24.16 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: O Kardama, I know that the original Supreme Personality of Godhead has now appeared as an incarnation by His internal energy. He is the bestower of all desired by the living entities, and He has now assumed the body of Kapila Muni.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: In this verse we find the words //puru·π£am avatƒ´r·πáa·πÅ sva-mƒÅyayƒÅ.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead is everlastingly, eternally the form of //puru·π£a,// the predominator or enjoyer, and when He appears He never accepts anything of this material energy. The spiritual world is a manifestation of His personal, internal potency, whereas the material world is a manifestation of His material, or differentiated, energy. The word //sva-mƒÅyayƒÅ,// "by His own internal potency," indicates that whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead descends, He comes in His own energy. He may assume the body of a human being, but that body is not material. In //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,// therefore, it is clearly stated that only fools and rascals, //m≈´·∏çhas,// consider the body of K·πõ·π£·πáa to be the body of a common human being. The word //≈õevadhim// means that He is the original bestower of all the necessities of life upon the living entities. In the //Vedas// also it is stated that He is the chief living entity and that He bestows all the desired necessities of other living entities. Because He is the bestower of the necessities of all others, He is called God. The Supreme is also a living entity; He is not impersonal. As we are individual, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is also individual---but He is the supreme individual. That is the difference between God and the ordinary living entities.

5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Honoring Srila Prabhupada's Teachings üïâ

As we delve into the profound wisdom of Srila Prabhupada's teachings, let us take a moment to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to our understanding of the Vedic scriptures and the philosophy of Krishna consciousness.

‚ú® Understanding the Lord's Energies ‚ú®

In Caitanya Caritamrta, Adi 12.14, Srila Prabhupada sheds light on the multifaceted nature of the Lord's energies. He explains that the Lord's internal energy is superior to His external energy. As he so eloquently puts it, *"The Lord's energies are multifarious, and His internal energy is superior to His external energy."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt)

But what does this mean, exactly? To understand this, let's explore the distinction between the internal and external energies.

**The Internal Energy: The Spiritual Realm**

The internal energy is responsible for the spiritual world, as Srila Prabhupada clarifies: *"The internal energy is responsible for the spiritual world, and the external energy is responsible for the material world."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt) This internal energy is the realm of pure consciousness, where the Lord's devotees reside in eternal bliss.

**The External Energy: The Material Realm**

In contrast, the external energy governs the material world, where we find ourselves entangled in the cycle of birth and death. This energy is characterized by ignorance, suffering, and duality.

**Our True Nature: Eternal Servants of the Lord**

Now, what about our place in this grand scheme? Srila Prabhupada reveals that *"The living entities are part of the Lord's internal energy, and they are eternal servants of the Lord."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt) This means that, at our core, we are spiritual beings, meant to serve the Lord with love and devotion.

‚ú® Reflection and Application ‚ú®

As we reflect on these teachings, let us remember that our true nature is not bound by the material world. We are eternal servants of the Lord, meant to reside in the spiritual realm of pure consciousness. By cultivating a deeper understanding of the Lord's energies, we can begin to shift our focus from the external to the internal, and ultimately, back to our eternal relationship with the Lord.

May Srila Prabhupada's teachings guide us on this journey of self-discovery and spiritual growth.
