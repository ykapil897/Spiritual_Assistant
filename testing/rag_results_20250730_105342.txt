### 📖 Health Update

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm? What is that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** You were having a missing beat in your pulse.

**Prabhupāda:** Huh?

**Bhakti-caru:** [explains to Prabhupāda in Bengali]

**Kavirāja:** [Hindi with Bhakti-caru and Prabhupāda]

**Bhakti-caru:** He is telling that he's requesting repeatedly that Prabhupāda doesn't talk too much. He says that the energy that he's building, the moment he starts talking, that he loses that energy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:** No, how to say all right?

[devotees chuckle]

**Kavirāja:** [Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:** [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** Trying to stop Śrīla Prabhupāda from speaking is like trying to stop the Gaṅgā.

**Kavirāja:** [Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:** [Hindi] Shastrijī's saying that he's seen lakhs of patients, but he hasn't seen a body like Śrīla Prabhupāda's. Like in one moment it is very critical, and the next moment it's in perfect order. And he is now absolutely confident that Prabhupāda is going to get well.

**Jagadīśa:** He is or isn't?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** He is. We also are.

**Bhakti-caru:** And he's just requesting Śrīla Prabhupāda that he keeps on taking the milk and the fruit juice and the medicine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:** English.

*Key Insight: Faith in the spiritual master and faith in Kṛṣṇa's will can overcome even the most critical health conditions.*
