🕉 Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada

✨ The Spiritual Master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu

As we delve into the Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, we find valuable insights into the life and teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. In Adi 12.14, we come across an interesting episode that reveals the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu.

**The Unhappiness of Acyutānanda**

When Acyutānanda heard from his father that Keśava Bhāratī was the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was very unhappy. ["When Acyutānanda heard from his father that Keśava Bhāratī was the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was very unhappy." (CC Adi 12.14, Purport)](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt)

This reaction from Acyutānanda might seem surprising, but it highlights the importance of understanding the spiritual lineage and the role of a spiritual master. In this case, Keśava Bhāratī was the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, as mentioned in the verse [CC Adi 12.14, Verse](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt).

**The Spiritual Master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu**

Keśava Bhāratī's role as the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu is a significant aspect of Lord Caitanya's life. This relationship is essential in understanding the teachings and mission of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "The spiritual master is the representative of the Lord, and one who is directly connected with the Lord is called a spiritual master." [CC Adi 1.35, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/1/35.txt)

In this context, Keśava Bhāratī's role as the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu emphasizes the importance of spiritual lineage and the guidance of a bonafide spiritual master.

**Reflection**

As we reflect on this episode, we are reminded of the significance of spiritual guidance and the importance of understanding our spiritual lineage. By acknowledging the role of Keśava Bhāratī as the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, we can deepen our appreciation for the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu and the importance of spiritual guidance in our own lives.

May we humbly acknowledge the guidance of our spiritual masters and strive to follow in the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu, under the guidance of Srila Prabhupada.
