### Reviving Original Consciousness

**Prabhupāda:** Ladies and gentlemen, this Kṛṣṇa conscious movement is reviving our original consciousness. At the present moment, due to our long association with matter, the consciousness has become contaminated, just like when the rain water falls down from the cloud, the water is uncontaminated, distilled water, pure, but as soon as the water falls down on this earth, it becomes mixed up with so many dirty things. When the water falls it is not salty, but when it is touched with the matter or earth, it becomes salty, or tasty, or something like that.

**Key Insight:** Our original consciousness is uncontaminated, but due to association with matter, it becomes contaminated.

Similarly, originally, as spirit soul, our consciousness is uncontaminated, but due to our association with the matter at the present moment, our consciousness is contaminated. Therefore we have got so many varieties of consciousness. Disagreements between one person to another is due to this contaminated consciousness. I think some way; you think otherwise. Therefore we do not agree.

**Key Insight:** Contaminated consciousness leads to disagreements and varieties of consciousness.

But originally, your consciousness and my consciousness were one. And what is that one? That conscious, pure consciousness, is "God is great, and I am His eternal servant." That is pure consciousness. As soon as we want to imitate or artificially want to become one with God, immediately the contamination begins.

**Key Insight:** Pure consciousness is "God is great, and I am His eternal servant."

There is a Bengali verse in which it is stated that,

SHLOKA:
**kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare**
**pāśate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare**
— *Prema-vivarta*

The English translation is that "When an individual soul forgets his eternal relationship with God and tries to lord it over the material nature or resources, that condition, that forgetful condition, is called **māyā**, or illusion."

**Key Insight:** Forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with God is **māyā**, or illusion.

So at the present moment, especially in this age, the forgetfulness of our eternal relationship with God is very strong. And by chanting this transcendental sound, **Hare Kṛṣṇa**, the first installment is that our heart or the mind becomes cleansed of all dirty things. This is not a theoretical proposition, but it is a fact.

**Key Insight:** Chanting **Hare Kṛṣṇa** cleanses the heart and mind of all dirty things.

If you go on chanting this **mantra**, **Hare Kṛṣṇa**, it is not difficult. Although it is pronounced in Sanskrit language, everyone can chant it just like in this meeting we began to chant, and you also joined with us. Here, all my students, they are all Americans. None of them are Indian, but still, they have learned it very nicely, and it is not difficult. And there is no expenditure.

**Key Insight:** Chanting **Hare Kṛṣṇa** is easy and accessible to everyone.

So what is this **Hare Kṛṣṇa**? **Hare** means the energy of the Lord, and **Kṛṣṇa** means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So it is a prayer. There are three words only: **Hare**, **Kṛṣṇa** and **Rāma**, three words. That has been arranged in sixteen words: **Hare Kṛṣṇa**, **Hare Kṛṣṇa**, **Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa**, **Hare Hare**/ **Hare Rāma**, **Hare Rāma**, **Rāma Rāma**, **Hare Hare**. So our movement is that we request you to take up these sixteen words---not sixteen words, three words, **Hare**, **Kṛṣṇa**, **Rāma**. But is is arranged in such a way that there are sixteen words. So anyone can take it by heart, these three words, and chant it.

*Key Insight: Take up the three words, **Hare**, **Kṛṣṇa**, and **Rāma**, and chant them to revive your original consciousness.*
