TRANSLATION: I have studied the path of understanding self-knowledge from my spiritual master, the Personality of Godhead, and thus after circumambulating Him I have come to this place, very much aggrieved due to separation.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Śrī Uddhava's actual life is the direct symbol of the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// enunciated first to Brahmājī by the Personality of Godhead [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]. These four very great and important verses from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are particularly taken out by the Māyāvādī speculators, who construe a different purport to suit their impersonal view of monism. Here is the proper answer to such unauthorized speculators. The verses of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are purely theistic science understandable by the postgraduate students of //Bhagavad-gītā,// The unauthorized dry speculators are offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because they distort the purports of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to mislead the public and prepare a direct path to the hell known as Andha-tāmisra. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:16:20|(Bg. 16.20)]] such envious speculators are without knowledge and are surely condemned life after life. They unnecessarily take shelter of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, but he was not so drastic as to commit an offense at the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. According to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya preached the Māyāvāda philosophy for a particular purpose. Such a philosophy was necessary to defeat the Buddhist philosophy of the nonexistence of the spirit soul, but it was never meant for perpetual acceptance. It was an emergency. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa was accepted by Śaṅkarācārya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his commentation on //Bhagavad-gītā.// Since he was a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he did not dare write any commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because that would have been a direct offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. But later speculators, in the name of Māyāvāda philosophy, unnecessarily make their commentary on the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36] without any bona fide intent.

The monistic dry speculators have no business in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because this particular Vedic literature is forbidden for them by the great author himself. Śrīla Vyāsadeva has definitely forbidden persons engaged in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, finally, salvation, from trying to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which is not meant for them [[books:sb:1:1:2|(SB 1.1.2)]]. Śrīpāda Śrīdhara Svāmī, the great commentator on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// has definitely forbidden the salvationists or monists to deal in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is not for them. Yet such unauthorized persons perversely try to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and thus they commit offenses at the feet of the Lord, which even Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya dared not do. Thus they prepare for their continuation of miserable life. It should be particularly noted herein that Uddhava studied the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]  directly from the Lord, who spoke them first to Brahmājī, and this time the Lord explained more confidentially the self-knowledge mentioned as the //paramāṁ sthitim.// Upon learning such self-knowledge of love, Uddhava felt very much aggrieved by feelings of separation from the Lord. Unless one is awakened to the stage of Uddhava---everlastingly feeling the separation of the Lord in transcendental love, as exhibited by Lord Caitanya also---one cannot understand the real import of the four essential verses of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// One should not indulge in the unauthorized act of twisting the meaning and thereby putting himself on the dangerous path of offense.

REFERENCE: SB 5.15.1 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: The son of Mahārāja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of Ṛṣabhadeva, but some unscrupulous people imagined him to be Lord Buddha himself. These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the //ārya-samāja,// which is ignorant of the import of the //Vedas// in the //paramparā// system. Their leaders decry all bona fide //ācāryas,// and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These //ācāryas// who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the //ārya-samājas,// or the Jains. Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha. Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they claim to be the descendants of Ṛṣabhadeva. Those who are Vaiṣṇavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the //Vedas.// In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]] Kṛṣṇa says, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// "The real purpose of the //Vedas// is to understand Me." This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures. One who does not know the greatness of Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot be accepted as an Āryan. Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of //bhāgavata-dharma.// He preached almost exclusively among atheists. Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit. Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God. Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God.

REFERENCE: SB 6.1.16 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: My dear King, if a sinful person engages in the service of a bona fide devotee of the Lord and thus learns how to dedicate his life unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he can be completely purified. One cannot be purified merely by undergoing austerity, penance, brahmacarya and the other methods of atonement I have previously described.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: //Tat-puruṣa// refers to a preacher of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, such as the spiritual master. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has said, //chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā:// "Without serving a bona fide spiritual master, an ideal Vaiṣṇava, who can be delivered from the clutches of //māyā//?" This idea is also expressed in many other places. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:5:2|(5.5.2)]] says, //mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ:// if one desires liberation from the clutches of //māyā,// one must associate with a pure devotee //mahātmā.// A //mahātmā// is one who engages twenty-four hours daily in the loving service of the Lord. As Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:13|(Bg. 9.13)]]:

> mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha
> daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ
> bhajanty ananya-manaso
> jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam

"O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible." Thus the symptom of a //mahātmā// is that he has no engagement other than service to Kṛṣṇa. One must render service to a Vaiṣṇava in order to get freed from sinful reactions, revive one's original Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be trained in how to love Kṛṣṇa. This is the result of //mahātma-sevā.// Of course, if one engages in the service of a pure devotee, the reactions of one's sinful life are vanquished automatically. Devotional service is necessary not to drive away an insignificant stock of sins, but to awaken our dormant love for Kṛṣṇa. As fog is vanquished at the first glimpse of sunlight, one's sinful reactions are automatically vanquished as soon as one begins serving a pure devotee; no separate endeavor is required.

The word //kṛṣṇa-rpita-prāṇaḥ// refers to a devotee who dedicates his life to serving Kṛṣṇa, not to being saved from the path to hellish life. A devotee is //nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa,// or //vāsudeva-parāyaṇa,// which means that the path of Vāsudeva, or the devotional path, is his life and soul. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati// [[books:sb:6:17:28|(SB 6.17.28)]]: such a devotee is not afraid of going anywhere. There is a path toward liberation in the higher planetary systems and a path toward the hellish planets, but a //nārāyaṇa-para// devotee is unafraid wherever he is sent; he simply wants to remember Kṛṣṇa, wherever he may be. Such a devotee is unconcerned with hell and heaven; he is simply attached to rendering service to Kṛṣṇa. When a devotee is put into hellish conditions, he accepts them as Kṛṣṇa's mercy: //tat te 'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇaḥ// (SB 10.14.8). He does not protest, "Oh, I am such a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Why have I been put into this misery?" Instead he thinks, "This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy." Such an attitude is possible for a devotee who engages in the service of Kṛṣṇa's representative. This is the secret of success.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Invocation**

om tat sat

**The Offense of Māyāvādīs**

In the sacred scripture, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, we find a stern warning against the Māyāvādīs, or impersonalists, who dare to offend the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently states, "The unauthorized dry speculators are offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because they distort the purports of Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam to mislead the public and prepare a direct path to the hell known as Andha-tāmisra." [SB 3.4.20, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/4/20.txt)

**The Condemnation of Māyāvādīs**

These Māyāvādīs, who claim to have realized the self, are in fact condemned to life after life, without knowledge. As Srila Prabhupada quotes from Bhagavad-gītā, "As confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā (Bg. 16.20), such envious speculators are without knowledge and are surely condemned life after life." [SB 3.4.20, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/4/20.txt) This is a grave warning to those who would dare to distort the sacred scriptures for their own selfish purposes.

**The Humility of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya**

Even the great devotee, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, did not dare to write any commentary on Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, lest he commit an offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. As Srila Prabhupada notes, "But later speculators, in the name of Māyāvāda philosophy, unnecessarily make their commentary on the catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam [SB 2.9.33/34/35/36] without any bona fide intent." [SB 3.4.20, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/4/20.txt) This humility on the part of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya serves as a stark contrast to the arrogance of the Māyāvādīs.

**The Forbidden Territory of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam**

The monistic dry speculators have no business in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which is forbidden for them by the great author himself, Śrīla Vyāsadeva. As Srila Prabhupada quotes, "Śrīla Vyāsadeva has definitely forbidden persons engaged in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, finally, salvation, from trying to understand Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which is not meant for them (SB 1.1.2)." [SB 3.4.20, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/4/20.txt) This warning serves as a reminder to those who would seek to misuse the sacred scriptures for their own selfish purposes.

**Practical Application**

In conclusion, we must be cautious not to fall prey to the misconceptions of the Māyāvādīs, who claim to have realized the self but are in fact offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord. Instead, we should approach the sacred scriptures with humility and reverence, recognizing the authority of the great ācāryas and the warnings they have left for us. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently states, "The Bhāgavatam is the essence of all Vedic knowledge, and it is spoken by the incarnation of the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Dvaipāyana Vyāsadeva." [SB 1.1.1, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/1/1/1.txt) Let us approach this sacred scripture with the proper attitude, lest we fall into the trap of the Māyāvādīs.
