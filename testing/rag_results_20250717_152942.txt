**Facts:**

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Invocation**
śrī-caitanya-mano-'bhīṣṭaṁ sthāpitaṁ yena bhū-tale
svayaṁ rūpaḥ kadā mahyam dadāti sva-padāntikam
("May the Supreme Lord who has established the mission to distribute love of Godhead, and who is the reservoir of all pleasure, grant me a place at His lotus feet.") - Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 1.1

**The Divine Incarnation of Lord Caitanya**

In the sacred scripture, Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, we find a profound revelation about the divine incarnation of Lord Caitanya. In the Ādi-līlā, Chapter 5, Text 6, it is stated:

"That original Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in Navadvīpa as Lord Caitanya" [CC Adi 5.6](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/5/6.txt)

This verse establishes the fundamental concept that Lord Caitanya is the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This revelation is of utmost importance, as it highlights the divine nature of Lord Caitanya's appearance in the material world.

**The Divine Companion: Lord Nityānanda**

Furthermore, the same verse reveals that Lord Nityānanda is the incarnation of Balarāma, the eternal companion of Lord Kṛṣṇa:

"Balarāma appeared with Him as Lord Nityānanda" [CC Adi 5.6](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/5/6.txt)

This divine relationship between Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda is a manifestation of the eternal love and affection between Lord Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Their appearance in the material world is a blessing for all living beings, as it provides an opportunity for spiritual awakening and devotional service.

**Reflection**

As neophyte devotees, we should understand the significance of Lord Caitanya's incarnation and His divine relationship with Lord Nityānanda. By recognizing their divine nature, we can develop a deeper appreciation for the mercy they have bestowed upon us. Let us take advantage of this opportunity to surrender ourselves at the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda, and thus experience the bliss of devotional service.

**Practical Application**

As we reflect on the divine incarnation of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda, let us make a conscious effort to cultivate a sense of reverence and gratitude for their appearance in our lives. By doing so, we can deepen our connection with the divine and experience the transformative power of their love
