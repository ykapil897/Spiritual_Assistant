### Sense Gratification and Spiritual Life

**Prabhupāda:** The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other anarthas, drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. Therefore if you will give us some chance...

**Mr. Loomis:** Could I ask a question? I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not.

**Prabhupāda:** Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, that kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10]. Sense gratification is required as far as, as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification.

Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest. But not that we shall sleep twenty-four hours or twenty hours and enjoy, as in this country sometimes they enjoy sleeping. But sleeping is wasting time. So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized.

You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called tapasya, or advancement of spiritual life.

Eating, sleeping, sex and defense. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased. That is tapasya.

In the human life this is possible, this is possible. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. One can conquer over these things, by practice.

The more we minimize this āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna, this means we are advanced in spiritual taste. It is practiced. My, my personal life, I don't sleep at night. And nowadays, at most, one hour. Yes. But I take rest in the daytime, at least two to three hours. So it is not that I am sleeping one hour. I sleep three to four hours total. But if practiced, it can be reduced, practiced.

We see in the life of Gosvāmīs. About them, it is said: nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. They conquered over sleeping, eating. If we conquer over eating, then we can conquer over sleeping and other things also.

If we can control over this tongue, then we can control over the other senses very easily. That is a fact. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre. Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent.

So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the śāstra also it is said sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ [Brs. 1.2.234]. Our present senses are unable to understand śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi, the holy name of the Lord.

*Key Insight: Sense gratification is never helpful; it should be minimized and controlled, not increased. Only then can we advance in spiritual life.*

### The Temporary Senses

**Prabhupāda:** There is no purport of Devahūti?

**Nitāi:** "Here the word _asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt_ is significant. _Asat_ means 'impermanent,' 'temporary,' and _indriya_ means 'senses.' Thus _asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt_ means 'from being agitated by the temporarily manifest senses of the material body.' We are evolving through different statuses of material bodily existence—sometimes in a human body, sometimes in an animal body—and therefore the engagements of our material senses are also changing. Anything which changes is called temporary, or _asat_. We should know that beyond these temporary senses are our permanent senses, which are now covered by the material body. The permanent senses, being contaminated by matter, are not acting properly. Devotional service, therefore, involves freeing the senses from this contamination. When the contamination is completely removed and the senses act in the purity of unalloyed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we have reached the _sad-indriya_, or eternal sense activities. The eternal sensual activities are called devotional service, whereas temporary sensual activities are called sense gratification. Unless one becomes tired of material sense gratification, there is no opportunity to hear transcendental messages from a person like Kapila. Devahūti expressed that she was tired. Now that her husband had left home, she wanted to get relief by hearing the instructions of Lord Kapila."

*Key Insight: The temporary material senses must be freed from contamination to reveal our eternal, pure senses, which engage in devotional service.*

### Ideal Society and Devotional Instruction

**Prabhupāda:** So this full book is the answer and question between mother and son. So, although she is mother, she has given birth to the child, but she has become now dependent on this child for good instruction. This is ideal society.

*Key Insight: In an ideal society, even family relationships become a means for spiritual growth and guidance.*

### Spiritual Advice for Indians Abroad

**Indian guest:** How do you advise Indians who are here and who have fallen to some extent in the materialistic world? They did not leave... Basically, they left their homes, most of them, to educate themselves. When they came here, they educated themselves, and they don't want to go back. Basically, they have fallen into the materialistic world. What advice you render them so that they get out of these clutches and go back and serve here or in the country, but they should be devotional to the Almighty God?

**Prabhupāda:** So there is no question of "here" and "there." You can become advanced in spiritual life anywhere if you follow the principles. That we are teaching. We are opening centers all over the world. You take the advantage of our teaching, our books, our center. Then it will be all right. They are following, these Europeans and American boys. They are young boys. They are giving up meat-eating. Do you give up meat-eating? Why Indians, you should learn meat-eating? They are giving up, and you are learning to eat meat. This is the lesson, that these foreigners—-they were accustomed to eat meat from the childhood—-they are giving up, and you are eating meat. This is the instruction. Indians are drinking. They are giving up drinking. The lessons are already there. There is no question why. The lessons are already there, books are already there, the centers are already there.

*Key Insight: Spiritual growth is possible anywhere, regardless of location, by following spiritual principles and taking advantage of available resources and guidance.*

### The Importance of Tapasya

**Prabhupāda:** That is //tapasya// means we should restrict sense gratification. Sense gratification, either regulated or nonregulated, is meant for animal life. Sense control is the human life. Therefore you'll find in Vedic culture big, big learned scholars, big, big kings, they dedicated their life for //tapasya.

SHLOKA:
> tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.5.1*

**Prabhupāda:** If you want to purify your existence, then you must take to the process of //tapasya. Tapo divyam.// And what is that //tapasya? Tapasya// for realization of God. And then we shall be purified. What is meaning of purify, purification? Purification means we are eternal, and if we become purified from this material contamination, then we get back our eternal life, back to home, back to Godhead. That is required.

*Key Insight: Tapasya, or sense control, is necessary for human life to purify our existence and realize God.*

### The Dangers of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** That is not civilization. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[SB 5.5.1]]. This human life should be regulated in such a way that he hasn't got to satisfy the senses after taking so much hard labor. The modern civilization is like that. Everyone is engaged in hard labor simply for satisfaction of the senses. So they have become mad. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vi...// And they are acting without any consideration of the effect. They do not consider whether it is sinful or not. They do not believe in the next life. They do not discriminate what is sinful, what is pious---nothing. Exactly like animals.

*Key Insight: Sense gratification leads to madness and a lack of consideration for the consequences of our actions.*

### The Real Body and Senses

**Prabhupāda:** So //śāstra// says, "This is not good." Here also, Devahūti says that //bhūmann asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt. Asad-indriya-tarṣ...// Actually, these senses are not real senses. It is covered, just like my this body, covered with this shirt or this cloth. It is not my real body. Although you see the shirt has got a hand, that hand is not real hand. The real hand is within the shirt. Similarly, our real body is within this body.

SHLOKA:
> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 2.13*

**Prabhupāda:** //Dehinaḥ. Dehinaḥ// means the real body, or the spiritual body of the soul, is within this body. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe.// And the body is changing. //Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.// It is sometimes child, sometimes youth, sometimes a young man, sometimes old man. And then vanishes. It is... There are six changes. So this is not real body. But... And we are engaged in this unreal body, sense gratification. We have got senses.

*Key Insight: Our real body is spiritual and eternal, while the material body is temporary and changing.*

### Purifying the Senses

**Prabhupāda:** //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam// [[Bg. 6.21]]. //Atīndriya-grāhyam.// Beyond the senses. Therefore these senses are to be purified. That is called //tapasya. Tapo divyam// [[SB 5.5.1]]. And... Yes. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.// When we purify our senses... Senses you cannot destroy. That is not possible. Just like some..., somebody said that "You become desireless." Desireless... Desire is the mental activities. So we cannot be desireless. That is not possible. We have to purify the desire. That is required. That is recommended,

SHLOKA:
> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> — *Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya 19.170*

*Key Insight: We must purify our desires and senses to achieve spiritual realization and become engaged in devotional service.*

### The Misconception of Happiness

**Prabhupāda:** The whole structure of our body means the senses. We, everyone, animal and less intelligent men, are busy only for sense gratification.

**Prabhupāda:** They think sense gratification is happiness, but actually, that is not happiness.

SHLOKA:
> Sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyam
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 6.20-23*

**Prabhupāda:** What is actual happiness? That is //ātyantikam,// that is //atīndriya. Atīndriya// means beyond the senses.

**Prabhupāda:** But because we have no such knowledge, because we are in the bodily concept of life, "I am this body," so I am interested in the matter of gratifying my senses.

**Prabhupāda:** Those who are a little advanced, they are in the enjoyment of the mind, mental speculation, philosophy, or theosophy.

**Prabhupāda:** They derive poetry, writing poetry, nice poetry. They are not on the gross platform of sense gratification but on the subtle platform of sense... Mind is also sense.

**Prabhupāda:** Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]: "These eight elements, they are also My //prakṛti,// but //bhinnā,// separated, separated //prakṛti.//"

**Prabhupāda:** //Prakṛti// means subordinate to the //puruṣa.// As soon as the //prakṛti...// Generally, we understand that the husband and wife, wife is called //prakṛti,// and the husband is called //puruṣa.// So //puruṣa// means enjoyer, and //prakṛti// means enjoyed.

**Prabhupāda:** So similarly, when Kṛṣṇa says, //bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā,// that all these elements, gross and subtle---earth, water, air, fire, and these are gross elements, and the mind, intelligence, and ego, subtle elements...

**Prabhupāda:** Then Kṛṣṇa says, //apareyam:// "These elements are inferior //prakṛti.//" //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṭiṁ parām.// There is another //prakṛti.// What is that?

SHLOKA:
> Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 7.5*

**Prabhupāda:** //Jīva-bhūta,// the living entity. The living entity is also //prakṛti.// We are not //puruṣa.// But we forget this.

**Prabhupāda:** //Prakṛti// means to be used by the //puruṣa.// Therefore, our position is, real position is, we should be used by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //puruṣa,// Puruṣottama. This is our position.

**Prabhupāda:** But artificially we are trying to become the //puruṣa.// That is //māyā.// Instead of being utilized by the //puruṣa,// we are trying to become the //puruṣa,// to utilize the material nature.

**Prabhupāda:** //Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat.// The world is going on, the material world, because the living entities in the attitude of becoming //puruṣa,// they are trying to exploit the resources of this material nature.

*Key Insight: We are not the enjoyers, but the enjoyed. Our real position is to be used by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to try to become the enjoyers ourselves.*

### The Futility of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore the so-called yogis, fifteen minutes meditation or, say, fifteen hours meditation, or fifteen months meditation, but as soon as meditation finished—sense gratification. That's all. So this sense gratification program is very strong. And so long you will indulge in sense gratification, the repetition of birth and death will go on.

*Key Insight: Sense gratification perpetuates the cycle of birth and death.*

### The Consequences of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** This body... The Bhāgavata says that these people are working for sense gratification. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ means mad after sense gratification. And for sense gratification, they are acting so abominably that it is not to be uttered. Kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti. They have engaged their life in sense gratification. Na sādhu manye, oh this is not good. This is not good. Why? Yata, because, ātmanaḥ, the spirit soul, ātmano 'yam... Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [[SB 5.5.4]].

SHLOKA:
> āsann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ
> — *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 5.5.4*

*Key Insight: Sense gratification leads to suffering in the material body.*

### The Problem of Material Existence

**Prabhupāda:** This body is temporary, but so long this body is there, you'll have to suffer. What is that suffering? The sum total of suffering is birth, death, old age and disease. This is due to this body. Therefore the problem is how to stop this material body, repetition. Today I have got this body, Indian, tomorrow I may get American, next birth... Tomorrow means next birth. Next birth another, next birth another, next birth another—it is going on. Going on. There is no stoppage, this transmigration of the soul.

*Key Insight: The material body is the source of suffering and repetition of birth and death.*

### The Futility of Artificial Sense Control

**Prabhupāda:** But if you want to stop it artificially it is impossible. Neither by this yoga process, neither by this jñāna process. Simply for the time being you can check. Just like a naughty boy. By force, you can stop him acting mischievously. But as soon as he gets opportunity, again he will act so. Similarly, senses are very strong. You cannot stop them artificially.

*Key Insight: Artificially controlling the senses is futile and temporary.*

### The Remedy: Kṛṣṇa Consciousness

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore the only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These boys in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this is also sense gratification, eating nice prasāda, dancing, chanting, reading philosophy—but it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa. That is the significance. Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe. It is the sense gratification of Kṛṣṇa. Not directly, but because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, my senses are automatically satisfied.

*Key Insight: Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only remedy to stop sense gratification and achieve liberation.*

### The Failure of Artificial Sense Control

**Prabhupāda:** Artificially if you want to stop your senses, you will fail. That Kṛṣṇa says, "One who restrains the sense and organs of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects." Just like Viśvāmitra Muni. There were many instances. He was a great king and he wanted to be yogi. And he went to forest, gave up his kingdom, went to forest.

*Key Insight: Artificial sense control is doomed to fail, as exemplified by the story of Viśvāmitra Muni.*

### Sense Gratification and Spiritual Life

**Prabhupāda:** The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other anarthas, drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. Therefore if you will give us some chance...

**Mr. Loomis:** Could I ask a question? I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not.

**Prabhupāda:** Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, that kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10]. Sense gratification is required as far as, as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification.

Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest. But not that we shall sleep twenty-four hours or twenty hours and enjoy, as in this country sometimes they enjoy sleeping. But sleeping is wasting time. So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized.

You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called tapasya, or advancement of spiritual life.

Eating, sleeping, sex and defense. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased. That is tapasya.

In the human life this is possible, this is possible. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. One can conquer over these things, by practice.

The more we minimize this āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna, this means we are advanced in spiritual taste. It is practiced. My, my personal life, I don't sleep at night. And nowadays, at most, one hour. Yes. But I take rest in the daytime, at least two to three hours. So it is not that I am sleeping one hour. I sleep three to four hours total. But if practiced, it can be reduced, practiced.

We see in the life of Gosvāmīs. About them, it is said: nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. They conquered over sleeping, eating. If we conquer over eating, then we can conquer over sleeping and other things also.

If we can control over this tongue, then we can control over the other senses very easily. That is a fact. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre. Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent.

So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the śāstra also it is said sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ [Brs. 1.2.234]. Our present senses are unable to understand śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi, the holy name of the Lord.

*Key Insight: Sense gratification is never helpful; it should be minimized and controlled, not increased. Only then can we advance in spiritual life.*

### The Temporary Senses

**Prabhupāda:** There is no purport of Devahūti?

**Nitāi:** "Here the word _asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt_ is significant. _Asat_ means 'impermanent,' 'temporary,' and _indriya_ means 'senses.' Thus _asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt_ means 'from being agitated by the temporarily manifest senses of the material body.' We are evolving through different statuses of material bodily existence—sometimes in a human body, sometimes in an animal body—and therefore the engagements of our material senses are also changing. Anything which changes is called temporary, or _asat_. We should know that beyond these temporary senses are our permanent senses, which are now covered by the material body. The permanent senses, being contaminated by matter, are not acting properly. Devotional service, therefore, involves freeing the senses from this contamination. When the contamination is completely removed and the senses act in the purity of unalloyed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we have reached the _sad-indriya_, or eternal sense activities. The eternal sensual activities are called devotional service, whereas temporary sensual activities are called sense gratification. Unless one becomes tired of material sense gratification, there is no opportunity to hear transcendental messages from a person like Kapila. Devahūti expressed that she was tired. Now that her husband had left home, she wanted to get relief by hearing the instructions of Lord Kapila."

*Key Insight: The temporary material senses must be freed from contamination to reveal our eternal, pure senses, which engage in devotional service.*

### Ideal Society and Devotional Instruction

**Prabhupāda:** So this full book is the answer and question between mother and son. So, although she is mother, she has given birth to the child, but she has become now dependent on this child for good instruction. This is ideal society.

*Key Insight: In an ideal society, even family relationships become a means for spiritual growth and guidance.*

### Spiritual Advice for Indians Abroad

**Indian guest:** How do you advise Indians who are here and who have fallen to some extent in the materialistic world? They did not leave... Basically, they left their homes, most of them, to educate themselves. When they came here, they educated themselves, and they don't want to go back. Basically, they have fallen into the materialistic world. What advice you render them so that they get out of these clutches and go back and serve here or in the country, but they should be devotional to the Almighty God?

**Prabhupāda:** So there is no question of "here" and "there." You can become advanced in spiritual life anywhere if you follow the principles. That we are teaching. We are opening centers all over the world. You take the advantage of our teaching, our books, our center. Then it will be all right. They are following, these Europeans and American boys. They are young boys. They are giving up meat-eating. Do you give up meat-eating? Why Indians, you should learn meat-eating? They are giving up, and you are learning to eat meat. This is the lesson, that these foreigners—-they were accustomed to eat meat from the childhood—-they are giving up, and you are eating meat. This is the instruction. Indians are drinking. They are giving up drinking. The lessons are already there. There is no question why. The lessons are already there, books are already there, the centers are already there.

*Key Insight: Spiritual growth is possible anywhere, regardless of location, by following spiritual principles and taking advantage of available resources and guidance.*

### The Importance of Tapasya

**Prabhupāda:** That is //tapasya// means we should restrict sense gratification. Sense gratification, either regulated or nonregulated, is meant for animal life. Sense control is the human life. Therefore you'll find in Vedic culture big, big learned scholars, big, big kings, they dedicated their life for //tapasya.

SHLOKA:
> tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam
> — *Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.5.1*

**Prabhupāda:** If you want to purify your existence, then you must take to the process of //tapasya. Tapo divyam.// And what is that //tapasya? Tapasya// for realization of God. And then we shall be purified. What is meaning of purify, purification? Purification means we are eternal, and if we become purified from this material contamination, then we get back our eternal life, back to home, back to Godhead. That is required.

*Key Insight: Tapasya, or sense control, is necessary for human life to purify our existence and realize God.*

### The Dangers of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** That is not civilization. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[SB 5.5.1]]. This human life should be regulated in such a way that he hasn't got to satisfy the senses after taking so much hard labor. The modern civilization is like that. Everyone is engaged in hard labor simply for satisfaction of the senses. So they have become mad. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vi...// And they are acting without any consideration of the effect. They do not consider whether it is sinful or not. They do not believe in the next life. They do not discriminate what is sinful, what is pious---nothing. Exactly like animals.

*Key Insight: Sense gratification leads to madness and a lack of consideration for the consequences of our actions.*

### The Real Body and Senses

**Prabhupāda:** So //śāstra// says, "This is not good." Here also, Devahūti says that //bhūmann asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt. Asad-indriya-tarṣ...// Actually, these senses are not real senses. It is covered, just like my this body, covered with this shirt or this cloth. It is not my real body. Although you see the shirt has got a hand, that hand is not real hand. The real hand is within the shirt. Similarly, our real body is within this body.

SHLOKA:
> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 2.13*

**Prabhupāda:** //Dehinaḥ. Dehinaḥ// means the real body, or the spiritual body of the soul, is within this body. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe.// And the body is changing. //Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.// It is sometimes child, sometimes youth, sometimes a young man, sometimes old man. And then vanishes. It is... There are six changes. So this is not real body. But... And we are engaged in this unreal body, sense gratification. We have got senses.

*Key Insight: Our real body is spiritual and eternal, while the material body is temporary and changing.*

### Purifying the Senses

**Prabhupāda:** //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam// [[Bg. 6.21]]. //Atīndriya-grāhyam.// Beyond the senses. Therefore these senses are to be purified. That is called //tapasya. Tapo divyam// [[SB 5.5.1]]. And... Yes. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.// When we purify our senses... Senses you cannot destroy. That is not possible. Just like some..., somebody said that "You become desireless." Desireless... Desire is the mental activities. So we cannot be desireless. That is not possible. We have to purify the desire. That is required. That is recommended,

SHLOKA:

> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-

### The Misconception of Happiness

**Prabhupāda:** The whole structure of our body means the senses. We, everyone, animal and less intelligent men, are busy only for sense gratification.

**Prabhupāda:** They think sense gratification is happiness, but actually, that is not happiness.

SHLOKA:
> Sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyam

**Prabhupāda:** What is actual happiness? That is //ātyantikam,// that is //atīndriya. Atīndriya// means beyond the senses.

**Prabhupāda:** But because we have no such knowledge, because we are in the bodily concept of life, "I am this body," so I am interested in the matter of gratifying my senses.

**Prabhupāda:** Those who are a little advanced, they are in the enjoyment of the mind, mental speculation, philosophy, or theosophy.

**Prabhupāda:** They derive poetry, writing poetry, nice poetry. They are not on the gross platform of sense gratification but on the subtle platform of sense... Mind is also sense.

**Prabhupāda:** Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]: "These eight elements, they are also My //prakṛti,// but //bhinnā,// separated, separated //prakṛti.//"

**Prabhupāda:** //Prakṛti// means subordinate to the //puruṣa.// As soon as the //prakṛti...// Generally, we understand that the husband and wife, wife is called //prakṛti,// and the husband is called //puruṣa.// So //puruṣa// means enjoyer, and //prakṛti// means enjoyed.

**Prabhupāda:** So similarly, when Kṛṣṇa says, //bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā,// that all these elements, gross and subtle---earth, water, air, fire, and these are gross elements, and the mind, intelligence, and ego, subtle elements...

**Prabhupāda:** Then Kṛṣṇa says, //apareyam:// "These elements are inferior //prakṛti.//" //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṭiṁ parām.// There is another //prakṛti.// What is that?

SHLOKA:
> Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat
> — *Bhagavad-gītā 7.5*

**Prabhupāda:** //Jīva-bhūta,// the living entity. The living entity is also //prakṛti.// We are not //puruṣa.// But we forget this.

**Prabhupāda:** //Prakṛti// means to be used by the //puruṣa.// Therefore, our position is, real position is, we should be used by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //puruṣa,// Puruṣottama. This is our position.

**Prabhupāda:** But artificially we are trying to become the //puruṣa.// That is //māyā.// Instead of being utilized by the //puruṣa,// we are trying to become the //puruṣa,// to utilize the material nature.

**Prabhupāda:** //Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat.// The world is going on, the material world, because the living entities in the attitude of becoming //puruṣa,// they are trying to exploit the resources of this material nature.

*Key Insight: We are not the enjoyers, but the enjoyed. Our real position is to be used by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to try to become the enjoyers ourselves.*

### The Futility of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore the so-called yogis, fifteen minutes meditation or, say, fifteen hours meditation, or fifteen months meditation, but as soon as meditation finished—sense gratification. That's all. So this sense gratification program is very strong. And so long you will indulge in sense gratification, the repetition of birth and death will go on.

*Key Insight: Sense gratification perpetuates the cycle of birth and death.*

### The Consequences of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** This body... The Bhāgavata says that these people are working for sense gratification. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ means mad after sense gratification. And for sense gratification, they are acting so abominably that it is not to be uttered. Kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti. They have engaged their life in sense gratification. Na sādhu manye, oh this is not good. This is not good. Why? Yata, because, ātmanaḥ, the spirit soul, ātmano 'yam... Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [[SB 5.5.4]].

SHLOKA:
> āsann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ
> — *Śrīmad Bhāgavatam 5.5.4*

*Key Insight: Sense gratification leads to suffering in the material body.*

### The Problem of Material Existence

**Prabhupāda:** This body is temporary, but so long this body is there, you'll have to suffer. What is that suffering? The sum total of suffering is birth, death, old age and disease. This is due to this body. Therefore the problem is how to stop this material body, repetition. Today I have got this body, Indian, tomorrow I may get American, next birth... Tomorrow means next birth. Next birth another, next birth another, next birth another—it is going on. Going on. There is no stoppage, this transmigration of the soul.

*Key Insight: The material body is the source of suffering and repetition of birth and death.*

### The Futility of Artificial Sense Control

**Prabhupāda:** But if you want to stop it artificially it is impossible. Neither by this yoga process, neither by this jñāna process. Simply for the time being you can check. Just like a naughty boy. By force, you can stop him acting mischievously. But as soon as he gets opportunity, again he will act so. Similarly, senses are very strong. You cannot stop them artificially.

*Key Insight: Artificially controlling the senses is futile and temporary.*

### The Remedy: Kṛṣṇa Consciousness

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore the only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These boys in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this is also sense gratification, eating nice prasāda, dancing, chanting, reading philosophy—but it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa. That is the significance. Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe. It is the sense gratification of Kṛṣṇa. Not directly, but because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, my senses are automatically satisfied.

*Key Insight: Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only remedy to stop sense gratification and achieve liberation.*

### The Failure of Artificial Sense Control

**Prabhupāda:** Artificially if you want to stop your senses, you will fail. That Kṛṣṇa says, "One who restrains the sense and organs of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects." Just like Viśvāmitra Muni. There were many instances. He was a great king and he wanted to be yogi. And he went to forest, gave up his kingdom, went to forest.

*Key Insight: Artificial sense control is doomed to fail, as exemplified by the story of Viśvāmitra Muni.*
