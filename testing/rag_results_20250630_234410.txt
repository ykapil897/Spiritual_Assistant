REFERENCE: SB 2.10.51 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī explained: I shall now explain to you the very subjects explained by the great sage in answer to King Parīkṣit's inquiries. Please hear them attentively.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Any question that is put forward may be answered by quoting the authority, and that satisfies the saner section. That is the system even in the law court. The best lawyer gives evidence from the past judgment of the court without taking much trouble to establish his case. This is called the //paramparā// system, and learned authorities follow it without manufacturing rubbish interpretations.

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> (Bs. 5.1)

Let us all obey the Supreme Lord, whose hand is in everything, without exception.

Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Second Canto, Tenth Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "//Bhāgavatam// Is the Answer to All Questions."

REFERENCE: SB 7.1.21 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: This matter is undoubtedly very wonderful. Indeed, my intelligence has become disturbed, just as the flame of a candle is disturbed by a blowing wind. O Nārada Muni, you know everything. Kindly let me know the cause of this wonderful event.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The //śāstras// enjoin, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet:// [MU 1.2.12] when one is perplexed by the difficult problems of life, to solve them one must approach a //guru// like Nārada or his representative in the disciplic succession. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira therefore requested Nārada to explain the cause for such a wonderful event.

As we approach this verse, let us remember the importance of seeking guidance from a self-realized guru and the authority of the paramparā system in understanding spiritual knowledge.

In conclusion, my dear devotee, let us cherish the wisdom of Srila Prabhupada and the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, and strive to deepen our understanding of these timeless teachings.
