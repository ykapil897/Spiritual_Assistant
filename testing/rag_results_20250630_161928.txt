TEXT: from K·πõ·π£·πáa; he simply wants to serve Him. And K·πõ·π£·πáa also looks for the opportunity to serve His devotee. K·πõ·π£·πáa is always as anxious to please His devotee as the devotee is to please Him. This is the transcendental world. On the absolute plane, there is no exploitation. Everyone wants to serve; no one wants to take service. In the transcendental world, everyone wants to give service. You want to give service to me, and I want to give service to you. This is such a nice attitude. This material world means that I want to pickpocket you, and you want to pickpocket me. That's all. This is the material world. We should try to understand it. In the material world, everyone wants to exploit his friend, his father, his mother, everyone. But in the transcendental world, everyone wants to serve. Everyone has K·πõ·π£·πáa as the central point of serving, and all the devotees, either as friends or servants or parents or lovers of K·πõ·π£·πáa, all want to serve Him. And at the same time, K·πõ·π£·πáa also wants to serve them. This is a transcendental relationship; the main function is service, although there is no necessity of service, for everyone is full. There is no hunger, there is no necessity of eating, but still everyone offers nice things to eat. This is the transcendental world. Unless we attain the stage of simply serving K·πõ·π£·πáa or His devotee, we cannot relish the transcendental pleasure of service. If we have any motive, then that sense will never be awakened. Without a motive, without desire for personal sense gratification, service should be rendered to the Supreme Lord and His devotees. ===== The Perfection of Self-realization ===== In this concluding chapter, ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda discusses the ultimate goal of the science of self-realization---full realization of the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The development of self-realization begins with the understanding that the self is not material---not a physical body---but pure spiritual energy. Next, one realizes that the pure, spiritual self is eternally a part of the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Finally one learns how to live fully in that eternal, blissful, transcendental relationship. One who has attained this state has attained life's supreme perfection. When K·πõ·π£·πáa was on this earth, all the residents of V·πõndƒÅvana loved Him. Indeed, they knew nothing but K·πõ·π£·πáa.

TEXT: "Who is ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda?" people often ask, and it is always a hard question to answer. For ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda always eclipsed conventional designations. At various times people have called him a scholar, a philosopher, a cultural ambassador, a prolific author, a religious leader, a spiritual teacher, a social critic, and a holy man. In truth, he was all these things and more. Certainly no one could ever have confused him with the modern entrepreneurial //"gurus"// who come to the West with slickly packaged, watered-down versions of Eastern spirituality (to satisfy our urge for instant well-being and exploit our well-documented spiritual naivete.) ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda was, rather, a true holy man (//sƒÅdhu//) of deep intellectual and spiritual sensitivity---he had deep concern and compassion for a society which, to such a large degree, lacks real spiritual dimension. For the enlightenment of human society, ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda produced some eighty volumes of translations and summary studies of India's great spiritual classics, and his work has seen print both in English and in many foreign languages. Also, in 1944 ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda single-handedly launched a magazine called //Back to Godhead,// which today has a monthly circulation of more than half a million copies in English alone. Nearly all the interviews, lectures, essays, and letters chosen for //The Science of Self Realization// first appeared in //Back to Godhead.// In these pages ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda presents the same message that the great sage VyƒÅsadeva recorded thousands of years ago, the message of ancient India's vedic literatures. As we shall see, he quotes freely and often from the //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,// the //≈örƒ´mad-BhƒÅgavatam,// and other classic vedic texts. He transmits in modern English the same timeless knowledge that other great self-realized teachers have spoken for millennia---knowledge that opens up the secrets of the self within us, nature and the universe, and the Supreme Self within and without. ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda speaks with startling clarity and a kind of convincing, simple eloquence and proves just how relevant the science of self-realization is to our modern world and our own lives. Among the thirty-six selections chosen for this special book, we hear ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda's moving poem upon his arrival in America, his exchange with a noted cardiologist on "soul research," his revelations to London Broadcasting Company on reincarnation, his telling remarks to the London //Times// on real and false //gurus,//

5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada, the embodiment of divine wisdom.

‚ú® **The Essence of Self-Realization**

As we embark on the journey of self-realization, it's essential to understand the fundamental principles that guide us towards the ultimate goal. Srila Prabhupada's teachings, rooted in ancient India's Vedic literatures, offer us a profound understanding of this journey.

**Service, Not Exploitation**

In the transcendental world, the atmosphere is characterized by service, not exploitation. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "In the transcendental world, everyone wants to serve. Everyone has K·πõ·π£·πáa as the central point of serving, and all the devotees, either as friends or servants or parents or lovers of K·πõ·π£·πáa, all want to serve Him. And at the same time, K·πõ·π£·πáa also wants to serve them." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/8.txt)

This concept of service is a far cry from the exploitation we often see in the material world. In the spiritual realm, service is not about personal gain or recognition; it's about surrendering to the will of the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa.

**The Ultimate Goal: Realizing the Supreme Self**

The ultimate goal of self-realization is to fully realize the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently puts it, "The Perfection of Self-realization" [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/8.txt) is not about achieving some temporary state of bliss or enlightenment; it's about realizing our eternal relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa.

**The Foundation of Srila Prabhupada's Teachings**

Srila Prabhupada's teachings are firmly rooted in ancient India's Vedic literatures. As he transmits this timeless knowledge in modern English, we're reminded that "He transmits in modern English the same timeless knowledge that other great self-realized teachers have spoken for millennia---knowledge that opens up the secrets of the self within us, nature and the universe, and the Supreme Self within and without." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/0c.txt)

**Reflection**

As we reflect on these essential points, we're reminded that self-realization is not a solitary journey. It's a journey of service, surrender, and devotion to the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa. By embracing these principles, we can deepen our understanding of ourselves and the world around us, ultimately realizing our eternal relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa.

May Srila Prabhupada's teachings guide us on this transformative journey of self-realization.
