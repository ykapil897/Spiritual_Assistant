TRANSLATION: Knowledge is the ultimate perfection of self-realization. I shall explain that knowledge unto you by which the knots of attachment to the material world are cut.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: It is said that by proper understanding of the pure self, or by self-realization, one can be freed from material attachment. Knowledge leads one to attain the ultimate perfection of life and to see oneself as he is. The //≈övetƒÅ≈õvatara Upani·π£ad// (3.8) also confirms this. //Tam eva viditvƒÅti-m·πõtyum eti:// simply by understanding one's spiritual position, or by seeing oneself as he is, one can be freed from material entanglement. In various ways, the seeing of oneself is described in the Vedic literatures, and it is confirmed in the //BhƒÅgavatam// (//puru·π£asya ƒÅtma-dar≈õanam//) that one has to see oneself and know what he is. As Kapiladeva explains to His mother, this "seeing" can be done by hearing from the proper authoritative source. Kapiladeva is the greatest authority because He is the Personality of Godhead, and if someone accepts whatever is explained //as it is,// without interpretation, then he can see himself.

Lord Caitanya explained to SanƒÅtana GosvƒÅmƒ´ the real constitutional position of the individual. He said directly that each and every individual soul is eternally a servitor of K·πõ·π£·πáa. //Jƒ´vera 'svar≈´pa' haya-k·πõ·π£·πáera 'nitya-dƒÅsa':// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]] every individual soul is eternally a servitor. When one is fixed in the understanding that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul and that his eternal position is to serve in association with the Supreme Lord, he becomes self-realized. This position of rightly understanding oneself cuts the knot of material attraction (//h·πõdaya-granthi-bhedanam//). Due to false ego, or false identification of oneself with the body and the material world, one is entrapped by //mƒÅyƒÅ,// but as soon as one understands that he is qualitatively the same substance as the Supreme Lord because he belongs to the same category of spirit soul, and that his perpetual position is to serve, one attains //ƒÅtma-dar≈õanam// and //h·πõdaya-granthi-bhedanam,// self-realization. When one can cut the knot of attachment to the material world, his understanding is called knowledge. //ƒÄtma-dar≈õanam// means to see oneself by knowledge; therefore, when one is freed from the false ego by the cultivation of real knowledge, he sees himself, and that is the ultimate necessity of human life. The soul is thus isolated from the entanglement of the twenty-four categories of material nature. Pursuit of the systematic philosophic process called SƒÅ·πÖkhya is called knowledge and self-revelation.

REFERENCE: SB 3.5.15 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: O Maitreya, O friend of the distressed, the glories of the Supreme Lord can alone do good for people all over the world. Therefore, just as bees collect honey from flowers, kindly describe the essence of all topics---the topics of the Lord.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: There are many topics for different persons in different modes of material nature, but the essential topics are those in relationship with the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, materially affected conditioned souls are all more or less averse to topics of the Supreme Lord because some of them do not believe in the existence of God and some of them believe only in the impersonal feature of the Lord. In both cases there is nothing for them to say of God. Both the nonbelievers and the impersonalists deny the essence of all topics; therefore, they engage in topics of relativity in various ways, either in sense gratification or in mental speculation. For the pure devotees like Vidura, the topics of both the mundaners and the mental speculators are useless in all respects. Thus Vidura requested Maitreya to talk of the essence only, the talks of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and nothing else.

REFERENCE: SB 3.24.37 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: This path of self-realization, which is difficult to understand, has now been lost in the course of time. Please know that I have assumed this body of Kapila to introduce and explain this philosophy to human society again.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: It is not true that SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy is a new system of philosophy introduced by Kapila as material philosophers introduce new kinds of mental speculative thought to supersede that of another philosopher. On the material platform, everyone, especially the mental speculator, tries to be more prominent than others. The field of activity of the speculators is the mind; there is no limit to the different ways in which one can agitate the mind. The mind can be unlimitedly agitated, and thus one can put forward an unlimited number of theories. SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy is not like that; it is not mental speculation. It is factual, but at the time of Kapila it was lost.

In due course of time, a particular type of knowledge may be lost or may be covered for the time being; that is the nature of this material world. A similar statement was made by Lord K·πõ·π£·πáa in //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ. Sa kƒÅleneha mahatƒÅ yogo na·π£·π≠a·∏•:// "In course of time the //yoga// system as stated in //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ// was lost." It was coming in //paramparƒÅ,// in disciplic succession, but due to the passage of time it was lost. The time factor is so pressing that in the course of time everything within this material world is spoiled or lost. The //yoga// system of //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ// was lost before the meeting of K·πõ·π£·πáa and Arjuna. Therefore K·πõ·π£·πáa again enunciated the same ancient //yoga// system to Arjuna, who could actually understand //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ.// Similarly, Kapila also said that the system of SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy was not exactly being introduced by Him; it was already current, but in course of time it was mysteriously lost, and therefore He appeared to reintroduce it. That is the purpose of the incarnation of Godhead. //YadƒÅ yadƒÅ hi dharmasya glƒÅnir bhavati bhƒÅrata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Dharma// means the real occupation of the living entity. When there is a discrepancy in the eternal occupation of the living entity, the Lord comes and introduces the real occupation of life. Any so-called religious system that is not in the line of devotional service is called //adharma-sa·πÅsthƒÅpana.// When people forget their eternal relationship with God and engage in something other than devotional service, their engagement is called irreligion. How one can get out of the miserable condition of material life is stated in SƒÅ·πÖkhya philosophy, and the Lord Himself is explaining this sublime system.

5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada üïâ

As we delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada, let us first acknowledge the immense value of his contributions to our understanding of self-realization and the ultimate perfection of life.

‚ú® The Ultimate Perfection of Life ‚ú®

Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that **knowledge is the ultimate perfection of self-realization**. In the Srimad Bhagavatam (3.26.2, Purport), he states, *"Knowledge leads one to attain the ultimate perfection of life and to see oneself as he is."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/26/2.txt) This knowledge is not mere intellectual understanding, but a deep, spiritual realization of our true nature.

‚ú® Cutting the Knot of Material Attraction ‚ú®

When we attain this self-realization, we **cut the knot of material attraction**. As Srila Prabhupada explains, *"When one is fixed in the understanding that he is part and parcel of the Supreme Soul and that his eternal position is to serve in association with the Supreme Lord, he becomes self-realized."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/26/2.txt) This understanding liberates us from the bondage of material desires and attachments.

‚ú® The Glories of the Supreme Lord ‚ú®

Srila Prabhupada reminds us that **the glories of the Supreme Lord can alone do good for people all over the world**. In the Srimad Bhagavatam (3.5.15, Purport), he writes, *"The essential topics are those in relationship with the Supreme Lord."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/5/15.txt) By focusing on the Lord's glories, we can bring about true benefit to humanity.

‚ú® The Lost Path of Self-Realization ‚ú®

Unfortunately, **the path of self-realization, which is difficult to understand, has now been lost in the course of time**. As Srila Prabhupada laments, *"This path of self-realization, which is difficult to understand, has now been lost in the course of time."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/24/37.txt) It is our duty to revive this lost path and guide others towards the ultimate perfection of life.

‚ú® Reflection and Application ‚ú®

As we reflect on these essential teachings, let us ask ourselves: Are we genuinely seeking self-realization, or are we still entangled in material desires? Are we fixed in our understanding of our eternal position as servitors of the Supreme Lord? By introspecting and applying these teachings, we can make tangible progress on the path of self-realization and ultimately attain the ultimate perfection of life.
