TRANSLATION: I have studied the path of understanding self-knowledge from my spiritual master, the Personality of Godhead, and thus after circumambulating Him I have come to this place, very much aggrieved due to separation.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Śrī Uddhava's actual life is the direct symbol of the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// enunciated first to Brahmājī by the Personality of Godhead [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]. These four very great and important verses from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are particularly taken out by the Māyāvādī speculators, who construe a different purport to suit their impersonal view of monism. Here is the proper answer to such unauthorized speculators. The verses of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are purely theistic science understandable by the postgraduate students of //Bhagavad-gītā,// The unauthorized dry speculators are offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because they distort the purports of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to mislead the public and prepare a direct path to the hell known as Andha-tāmisra. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:16:20|(Bg. 16.20)]] such envious speculators are without knowledge and are surely condemned life after life. They unnecessarily take shelter of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, but he was not so drastic as to commit an offense at the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. According to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya preached the Māyāvāda philosophy for a particular purpose. Such a philosophy was necessary to defeat the Buddhist philosophy of the nonexistence of the spirit soul, but it was never meant for perpetual acceptance. It was an emergency. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa was accepted by Śaṅkarācārya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his commentation on //Bhagavad-gītā.// Since he was a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he did not dare write any commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because that would have been a direct offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. But later speculators, in the name of Māyāvāda philosophy, unnecessarily make their commentary on the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36] without any bona fide intent.

The monistic dry speculators have no business in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because this particular Vedic literature is forbidden for them by the great author himself. Śrīla Vyāsadeva has definitely forbidden persons engaged in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, finally, salvation, from trying to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which is not meant for them [[books:sb:1:1:2|(SB 1.1.2)]]. Śrīpāda Śrīdhara Svāmī, the great commentator on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// has definitely forbidden the salvationists or monists to deal in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is not for them. Yet such unauthorized persons perversely try to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and thus they commit offenses at the feet of the Lord, which even Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya dared not do. Thus they prepare for their continuation of miserable life. It should be particularly noted herein that Uddhava studied the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]  directly from the Lord, who spoke them first to Brahmājī, and this time the Lord explained more confidentially the self-knowledge mentioned as the //paramāṁ sthitim.// Upon learning such self-knowledge of love, Uddhava felt very much aggrieved by feelings of separation from the Lord. Unless one is awakened to the stage of Uddhava---everlastingly feeling the separation of the Lord in transcendental love, as exhibited by Lord Caitanya also---one cannot understand the real import of the four essential verses of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// One should not indulge in the unauthorized act of twisting the meaning and thereby putting himself on the dangerous path of offense.

REFERENCE: SB 6.14.5 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: O great sage, among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the following purport to this verse. Simply desiring //mukti,// or liberation, is insufficient; one must become factually liberated. When one understands the futility of the materialistic way of life, one becomes advanced in knowledge, and therefore he situates himself in the //vānaprastha// order, unattached to family, wife and children. One should then further progress to the platform of //sannyāsa,// the actual renounced order, never to fall again and be afflicted by materialistic life. Even though one desires to be liberated, this does not mean he is liberated. Only rarely is someone liberated. Indeed, although many men take //sannyāsa// to become liberated, because of their imperfections they again become attached to women, material activities, social welfare work and so on.

//Jñānīs, yogīs// and //karmīs// devoid of devotional service are called offenders. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //māyāvādī kṛṣṇe aparādhī:// one who thinks that everything is //māyā// instead of thinking that everything is Kṛṣṇa is called an //aparādhī,// or offender. Although the Māyāvādīs, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, they may nonetheless be counted among the //siddhas,// those who have realized the self. They may be considered nearer to spiritual perfection because at least they have realized what spiritual life is. If such a person becomes //nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa,// a devotee of Lord Nārāyaṇa, he is better than a //jīvan-mukta,// one who is liberated or perfect. This requires higher intelligence.

There are two kinds of //jñānīs.// One is inclined to devotional service and the other to impersonal realization. Impersonalists generally undergo great endeavor for no tangible benefit, and therefore it is said that they are husking paddy that has no grain (//sthūla-tuṣāvaghātinaḥ//). The other class of //jñānīs,// whose //jñāna// is mixed with //bhakti,// are also of two kinds---those who are devoted to the so-called false form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and those who understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead as //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], the actual spiritual form. The Māyāvādī devotees worship Nārāyaṇa or Viṣṇu with the idea that Viṣṇu has accepted a form of //māyā// and that the ultimate truth is actually impersonal. The pure devotee, however, never thinks that Viṣṇu has accepted a body of //māyā;// instead, he knows perfectly well that the original Absolute Truth is the Supreme Person. Such a devotee is actually situated in knowledge. He never merges in the Brahman effulgence. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:10:2:32|(10.2.32)]]:

> ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas
> tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ
> āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ
> patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ

"O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure. Even though they rise to the highest point of liberation by dint of severe penances and austerities, they are sure to fall down again into material existence, for they do not take shelter at Your lotus feet." Evidence of this same point is also given in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:11|(Bg. 9.11)]], wherein the Lord says:

> avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā
> mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam
> paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto
> mama bhūta-maheśvaram
> //// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]

"Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be." When rascals (//mūḍhas//) see that Kṛṣṇa acts exactly like a human being, they deride the transcendental form of the Lord because they do not know the //paraṁ bhāvam,// His transcendental form and activities. Such persons are further described in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:12|(Bg. 9.12)]] as follows:

> moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo
> mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ
> rākṣasīm āsurīṁ caiva
> prakṛtiṁ mohinīṁ śritāḥ

"Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated." Such persons do not know that Kṛṣṇa's body is not material. There is no distinction between Kṛṣṇa's body and His soul, but because less intelligent men see Kṛṣṇa as a human being, they deride Him. They cannot imagine how a person like Kṛṣṇa could be the origin of everything (//govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// ). Such persons are described as //moghāśāḥ,// baffled in their hopes. Whatever they desire for the future will be baffled. Even if they apparently engage in devotional service, they are described as //moghāśāḥ// because they ultimately desire to merge into the Brahman effulgence.

Those who aspire to be elevated to the heavenly planets by devotional service will also be frustrated, because this is not the result of devotional service. However, they are also given a chance to engage in devotional service and be purified. As stated in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:1:2:17|(1.2.17)]]:

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt satām

"Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Personality of Godhead, who is the Paramātmā [Supersoul] in everyone's heart and the benefactor of the truthful devotee, cleanses desire for material enjoyment from the heart of the devotee who relishes His messages, which are in themselves virtuous when properly heard and chanted."

Unless the dirt within the core of one's heart is cleansed away, one cannot become a pure devotee. Therefore the word //su-durlabhaḥ// ("very rarely found") is used in this verse. Not only among hundreds and thousands, but among millions of perfectly liberated souls, a pure devotee is hardly ever found. Therefore the words //koṭiṣv api// are used herein. Śrīla Madhvācārya gives the following quotations from the //Tantra Bhāgavata://

> nava-koṭyas tu devānām
> ṛṣayaḥ sapta-koṭayaḥ
> nārāyaṇāyanāḥ sarve
> ye kecit tat-parāyaṇāḥ

"There are ninety million demigods and seventy million sages, who are all called //nārāyaṇāyana,// devotees of Lord Nārāyaṇa. Among them, only a few are called //nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa.//"

> nārāyaṇāyanā devā
> ṛṣy-ādyās tat-parāyaṇāḥ
> brahmādyāḥ kecanaiva syuḥ
> siddho yogya-sukhaṁ labhan

The difference between the //siddhas// and //nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇas// is that direct devotees are called //nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇas// whereas those who perform various types of mystic //yoga// are called //siddhas.//

REFERENCE: SB 7.9.44 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: My dear Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, I see that there are many saintly persons indeed, but they are interested only in their own deliverance. Not caring for the big cities and towns, they go to the Himalayas or the forest to meditate with vows of silence [mauna-vrata]. They are not interested in delivering others. As for me, however, I do not wish to be liberated alone, leaving aside all these poor fools and rascals. I know that without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy. Therefore I wish to bring them back to shelter at Your lotus feet.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: This is the decision of the Vaiṣṇava, the pure devotee of the Lord. For himself he has no problems, even if he has to stay in this material world, because his only business is to remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person can go even to hell and still be happy. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaraṇyāḥ:// "O best of the great personalities, I am not at all afraid of material existence." The pure devotee is never unhappy in any condition of life. This is confirmed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:6:17:28|(6.17.28)]]:

> nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve
> na kutaścana bibhyati
> svargāpavarga-narakeṣv
> api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ

"Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord."

For a devotee, being situated in the heavenly planets and being in the hellish planets are equal, for a devotee lives neither in heaven nor in hell but with Kṛṣṇa in the spiritual world. The secret of success for the devotee is not understood by the //karmīs// and //jñānīs. Karmīs// therefore try to be happy by material adjustment, and //jñānīs// want to be happy by becoming one with the Supreme. The devotee has no such interest. He is not interested in so-called meditation in the Himalayas or the forest. Rather, his interest is in the busiest part of the world, where he teaches people Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement was started for this purpose. We do not teach one to meditate in a secluded place just so that one may show that he has become very much advanced and may be proud of his so-called transcendental meditation, although he engages in all sorts of foolish materialistic activity. A Vaiṣṇava like Prahlāda Mahārāja is not interested in such a bluff of spiritual advancement. Rather, he is interested in enlightening people in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because that is the only way for them to become happy. Prahlāda Mahārāja says clearly, //nānyaṁ tvad asya śaraṇaṁ bhramato 'nupaśye:// "I know that without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without taking shelter of Your lotus feet, one cannot be happy." One wanders within the universe, life after life, but by the grace of a devotee, a servant of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, one can get the clue to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then not only become happy in this world but also return home, back to Godhead. That is the real target in life. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are not at all interested in so-called meditation in the Himalayas or the forest, where one will only make a show of meditation, nor are they interested in opening many schools for //yoga// and meditation in the cities. Rather, every member of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is interested in going door to door to try to convince people about the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// the teachings of Lord Caitanya. That is the purpose of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be fully convinced that without Kṛṣṇa one cannot be happy. Thus the Kṛṣṇa conscious person avoids all kinds of pseudo spiritualists, transcendentalists, meditators, monists, philosophers and philanthropists.

4️⃣ FACT EXTRACTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Acknowledgment: Srila Prabhupada's teachings are a treasure trove of spiritual wisdom, and it is an honor to extract key facts from his works.

Here are the extracted key facts:

FACT: Māyāvādīs, impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa because they think everything is māyā instead of thinking everything is Kṛṣṇa. | SOURCE: SB 6.14.5, Purport | QUOTE: "Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, māyāvādī kṛṣṇe aparādhī: one who thinks that everything is māyā instead of thinking that everything is Kṛṣṇa is called an aparādhī, or offender." | URL: https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/6/14/5.txt

FACT: Māyāvādīs are offenders because they do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the ultimate truth, but instead try to merge into the Brahman effulgence. | SOURCE: SB 6.14.5, Purport | QUOTE: "Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-gītā (9.11) as fools who deride Me when I descend in the human form." | URL: https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/6/14/5.txt

FACT: The Māyāvādīs' intelligence is impure because they think they can become one with the Supreme, but they do not take shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. | SOURCE: SB 6.14.5, Purport | QUOTE: "O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure." | URL: https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/6/14/5.txt

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Sri Guru Parampara**

**The Offense of Māyāvādīs**

**Text 1: The Māyāvādī Offense**

"Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, māyāvādī kṛṣṇe aparādhī: one who thinks that everything is māyā instead of thinking that everything is Kṛṣṇa is called an aparādhī, or offender." (SB 6.14.5, Purport)

In this verse, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu reveals the grave offense of the Māyāvādīs, who, in their ignorance, consider everything to be māyā, or illusion, rather than recognizing the supreme reality of Kṛṣṇa. This misconception is a direct affront to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and thus, the Māyāvādīs are considered offenders.

**Text 2: The Folly of Māyāvādīs**

"Such persons are further described in Bhagavad-gītā (9.11) as fools who deride Me when I descend in the human form." (SB 6.14.5, Purport)

The Māyāvādīs, in their arrogance, attempt to merge into the Brahman effulgence, neglecting the ultimate truth of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This foolishness is condemned in Bhagavad-gītā, where the Lord Himself declares that those who deride Him in His human form are indeed fools.

**Text 3: The Impurity of Māyāvādī Intelligence**

"O Lord, the intelligence of those who think themselves liberated but who have no devotion is impure." (SB 6.14.5, Purport)

The Māyāvādīs, in their misguided pursuit of liberation, fail to take shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Consequently, their intelligence is tainted by impurity, rendering their efforts futile.

**Conclusion**

The Māyāvādīs, in their ignorance, commit a grave offense against the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their misconception of considering everything as māyā, their attempt to merge into the Brahman effulgence, and their lack of devotion all contribute to their impure intelligence. As devotees, we must be cautious not to fall prey to such misconceptions and instead, take shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, recognizing His supreme reality in all aspects of existence.

**Practical Application**

In our daily lives, we can avoid the Māyāvādī mentality by cultivating a deep sense of devotion and recognition of Kṛṣṇa's presence in all things. By doing so, we can ensure that our intelligence remains pure and focused on the ultimate truth. As Śrīla Prabhupāda so eloquently puts it, "Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate truth, and everything else is a manifestation of Kṛṣṇa." (Lecture, 1966)
