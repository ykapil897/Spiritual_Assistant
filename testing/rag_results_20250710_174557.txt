TEXT: rich---everyone. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:18|(5.18)]]: > vidyā-vinaya-sampanne > brāhmaṇe ga vi hastini > śuni caiva śvapāke ca > paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ "The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle //brāhmaṇa,// a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater." **Ms. Nixon:** Could you explain the meaning of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra?// **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** It is very simple. //Hare// means, "O energy of the Lord," and //Kṛṣṇa// means, "O Lord Kṛṣṇa." Just as there are males and females in the material world, similarly, God is the original male (//puruṣa//), and His energy (//prakṛti//) is the original female. So, when we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, we are saying, "O Lord Kṛṣṇa, O energy of Kṛṣṇa, kindly engage me in Your service." **Ms. Nixon:** Could you please tell me a little bit about your life and how you knew that you were the spiritual master of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement? **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** My life is simple. I was a householder with a wife and children---now I have grandsons---when my spiritual master ordered me to go to the Western countries and preach the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So I left everything on the order of my spiritual master, and now I am trying to execute his order and the orders of Kṛṣṇa. **Ms. Nixon:** How old were you when he told you to go to the West? **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** At our first meeting, he ordered me to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West. I was then twenty-five years old, a married man with two children. I tried my best to carry out his orders and started managing //Back to Godhead// magazine in 1944, when I was still in household life. I started writing books in 1959 after retiring from family life, and in 1965 I came to the United States. **Ms. Nixon:** You have said that you are not God, and yet it appears to me, as an outsider, that your devotees treat you as if you were God. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Yes, that is their duty. Because the spiritual master is executing God's order, he should be respected as much as God, just as a government officer should be respected as much as the government because he executes the government's order. Even if an ordinary policeman comes, you have to

TEXT: 1970 \\ J. F. Staal \\ Professor of Philosophy and of South Asian Languages \\ My dear Dr. Staal: I am very glad to receive your letter dated Sunday, February 8, 1970. I am very much pleased also to note the contents. Regarding convincing you that all scriptures prescribe chanting of the name of Kṛṣṇa, I can simply present the authority of Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya recommended, //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// ["Hari, Kṛṣṇa, is constantly to be praised" (//Śikṣāṣṭaka// 3) [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]]. Similarly, Madhvācārya quotes, //vede rāmāyaṇe caiva hariḥ sarvatra gīyate// ["Hari is sung about everywhere in the //Vedas// and //Rāmāyaṇa//"]. Similarly, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(15.15)]] the Lord says, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// ["By all the //Vedas,// I am to be known"]. In this way we find all the scriptures aiming at the Supreme Person. In the //Ṛg Veda// (1.22.20) the //mantra// is //oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ// ["The demigods are always looking to that supreme abode of Viṣṇu"]. The whole Vedic process, therefore, is to understand Lord Viṣṇu, and any scripture is directly or indirectly chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. Regarding the //Bhagavad-gītā,// verse 9.14, //kīrtayantaḥ// certainly means glorifying, chanting, reciting, and talking, as you have said; but glorifying, chanting, or reciting about whom? It is certainly Kṛṣṇa. The word used in this connection is //mām// ["Me"]. Therefore, we do not disagree when a person glorifies Kṛṣṇa, as Śukadeva did in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// This is also //kīrtana.// The highest among all Vedic literatures is the proper place for such glorification of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, and this is to be well understood from the verse: > nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ > śuka-mukhād amṛta-drava-saṁyutam > pibata bhāgavataṁ rasam ālayaṁ > muhur aho rasikā bhuvi bhāvukāḥ > [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]] **"O expert and thoughtful men, relish //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls."** [[books:sb:1:1:3|(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.1.3)]] It is said that Mahārāja Parīkṣit attained salvation simply by hearing, and similarly Śukadeva Gosvāmī attained salvation simply by chanting. In our devotional service there are nine different methods for achieving the same goal, love of Godhead, and the first process

TEXT: joyful hearing Your name, and thus do all become attached to You." [[books:bg:11:36|(Bg. 11.36)]] The process of chanting is herein authorized as the direct means of contacting the Supreme Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. Simply by chanting the holy name Kṛṣṇa, the soul is attracted by the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa, to go home, back to Godhead. In the //Nārada-pañcarātra// it is stated that all the Vedic rituals, //mantras,// and understanding are compressed into the eight words Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. Similarly, in the //Kali-santaraṇa Upaniṣad// it is stated that these sixteen words, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, are especially meant for counteracting the degrading and contaminating influence of this materialistic age of Kali. All these points are elaborately presented in my book //Teachings of Lord Caitanya.// The process of chanting is, therefore, not only the sublime method for practical perfection of life but the authorized Vedic principle inaugurated by the greatest Vedic scholar and devotee, Lord Caitanya (whom we consider an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa). We are simply following in His authorized footsteps. The scope of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is universal. The process for regaining one's original spiritual status of eternal life, full with bliss and knowledge, is not abstract, dry theorizing. Spiritual life is not described in the //Vedas// as theoretical, dry, or impersonal. The //Vedas// aim at the inculcation of pure love of God only, and this harmonious conclusion is practically realized by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, or by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// As the goal of spiritual realization is only one, love of God, so the //Vedas// stand as a single comprehensive whole in the matter of transcendental understanding. Only the incomplete views of various parties apart from the bona fide Vedic lines of teaching give a rapturous appearance to the //Bhagavad-gītā.// The reconciliative factor adjusting all apparently diverse propositions of the //Vedas// is the essence of the //Veda,// or Kṛṣṇa consciousness (love of God). Thanking you once again, Yours sincerely, \\ A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami ---- February 8, 1970 \\ Swami A.C. Bhaktivedanta \\ Dear Swamiji: Thank you very much for your kindness in sending me your long and interesting letter of January 30, together with the last issue of //Back to Godhead.// So

TEXT: The process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be very vigorously propagated all over the world. Simply by seeing the Deity or simply by joining in chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// people will derive tremendous benefit. If one performs //kīrtana,// chanting, one will be able to think of Kṛṣṇa. One may think, "I danced for two hours and chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is the meaning of this?" This is //smaraṇa,// thinking of Kṛṣṇa. One may even think, "I foolishly chanted 'Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa' for two hours." But that also is //smaraṇa.// Because the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading, people are purchasing our books about Kṛṣṇa. Because they are curious they say, "What is this Kṛṣṇa? Let us see the book." Then they immediately see a picture of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and if they open the book they will see more. In the book there are many prayers glorifying Kṛṣṇa. So some will hear about Kṛṣṇa, and others will read, and if they are fortunate enough they will become Kṛṣṇa conscious and engage in the worship of the Deity. These methods of devotional service---hearing, chanting, remembering Kṛṣṇa, and so on---are so perfect that as soon as one takes to them (either all of them, some of them, or even one of them) one becomes purified. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī prays, "I offer my worship to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for simply by remembering Him, simply by glorifying Him, or simply by seeing Him, so many benefits follow." Śukadeva Gosvāmī is one of twelve important spiritual authorities, and these are the authorities we must follow (//mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]). He affirms that by performing these methods of devotional service one will be cleansed of material contamination. When? //Sadyaḥ:// immediately, without waiting. This is the great benefit of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

You are the almighty God, and I offer You my respectful obeisances.**\\ [[books:sb:1:8:43|—Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.8.43]] A summary of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is made herein by Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī. The almighty Lord has His eternal, transcendental abode, where He is engaged in keeping //surabhi// cows. He is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. He descends on the material world to reclaim His devotees and to annihilate the disturbing elements in groups of political parties and kings who are supposed to be in charge of administration work. He creates, maintains, and annihilates by His unlimited energies, and still He is always full with prowess and does not deteriorate in potency. The cows, the //brāhmaṇas,// and the devotees of the Lord are all objects of His special attention because they are very important factors for the general welfare of living beings. Kuntī addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as //kṛṣṇa-sakha// because she knows that although Arjuna, who is also known as Kṛṣṇa, is her son and therefore subordinate to her, Lord Kṛṣṇa is more intimately related with Arjuna than with her. Kṛṣṇā is also a name of Draupadī, and so the word //kṛṣṇa-sakha// also indicates Lord Kṛṣṇa's relationship with Draupadī, whom He saved from being insulted when Duryodhana and Karṇa attempted to strip her naked. Kuntī also addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as //vṛṣṇi-ṛṣabha,// the child of the dynasty of Vṛṣṇi. It was because Kṛṣṇa appeared in the Vṛṣṇi dynasty that this dynasty became famous, just as Malaysia and the Malaya Hills became famous because of the sandalwood that grows there. Kuntīdevī also addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as the destroyer of the political parties or royal dynasties that disturb the earth. In every monarchy, the king is honored very gorgeously. Why? Since he is a human being and the other citizens are also human beings, why is

TEXT: asked his wife, "What will make you comfortable?" A woman's nature, of course, is that she wants a good house, good food, fine garments, good children, and a good husband. These are a woman's ambitions. Thus Kardama Muni proved to her that she had received the best husband. By yogic powers he created for her this great airplane and gave her a big house with maidservants and all opulences. Kardama Muni was merely a human being, but he could perform such wonderful things by yogic powers. Kṛṣṇa, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers. If we get a little mystic power we become important, but Kṛṣṇa is the master of all mystic powers. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that wherever there is Yogeśvara, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all mystic powers, and wherever there is Arjuna, who is also known as Pārtha or Dhanur-dhara, everything is present. We should always remember that if we can keep ourselves always in company with Kṛṣṇa, we shall attain all perfection. And especially in this age, Kṛṣṇa has incarnated as the holy name (//kali-kāle nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa-avatāra,// Cc. //Ādi// 17.22). Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says: > nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis > tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ "My dear Lord, You are so kind that You are giving me Your association in the form of Your holy name, and this holy name can be chanted in any situation." There are no hard and fast rules for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. One can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa anywhere. Children, for example, also chant and dance. It is not at all difficult. While walking, our students take their beads with them and chant. Where is the loss? But the gain is very great, for by chanting we associate with Kṛṣṇa personally. Suppose we were to associate personally with the President. How proud we would feel. "Oh, I am with the President." So should we not feel very much proud if we were to associate with the supreme president, who is able to create many millions of presidents like those of this world? This chanting is our opportunity to do so. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi:// "My dear Lord, You are so kind to me that You are always prepared to give me Your association." //Durdaivam

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Session Title:** Glorifying the Supreme Lord Krsna: Unveiling the Majesty of the Divine

**Gita Reference:** Bhagavad-gita, Chapter 10, Text 12-13

**Opening Hook:**
Let us begin with a powerful quote from Srila Prabhupada's Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 26: "O Krsna, O friend of Arjuna, O chief among the descendants of Vrsni, You are the destroyer of those political parties which are disturbing elements on this earth. Your prowess never deteriorates. You are the proprietor of the transcendental abode, and You descend to relieve the distresses of the cows, the brahmanas, and the devotees, You possess all mystic powers, and You are the preceptor of the entire universe. You are the almighty God, and I offer You my respectful obeisances." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/26.txt/)

This quote sets the tone for our discussion today, as we delve into the majesty of the Supreme Lord Krsna and explore the significance of glorifying Him.

**Core Teaching:**
In the Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 13, Srila Prabhupada reminds us that "Krsna, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers. If we get a little mystic power we become important, but Krsna is the master of all mystic powers." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/13.txt/) This statement highlights Krsna's unparalleled position as the Supreme Lord, possessing all mystic powers and being the ultimate authority.

**Frameworks or Levels:**
When we glorify the Supreme Lord Krsna, we are not simply praising a deity; we are acknowledging His supreme position as the creator, maintainer, and destroyer of the universe. This understanding is essential in our spiritual journey, as it helps us develop a deeper sense of reverence and humility.

**Practical Application:**
So, how can we practically apply this understanding in our daily lives? One way is by chanting the holy name of Krsna, as emphasized in Science of Self Realization, Chapter 3: "The process of chanting is, therefore, not only the sublime method for practical perfection of life but the authorized Vedic principle inaugurated by the greatest Vedic scholar and devotee, Lord Caitanya (whom we consider an incarnation of Krsna)." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/3.txt/) By chanting the holy name, we are not only glorifying Krsna but also connecting with Him on a deeper level.

**Micro-practice:**
Take a few minutes each day to chant the Hare Krsna mantra, focusing on the sound and the meaning. As you chant, reflect on Krsna's supreme position and His role in your life.

**Closing Reflection:**
In conclusion, glorifying the Supreme Lord Krsna is not just a matter of ritualistic worship; it is a profound acknowledgment of His majesty and our dependence on Him. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently puts it in Science of Self Realization, Chapter 3: "The reconciliative factor adjusting all apparently diverse propositions of the Vedas is the essence of the Veda, or Krsna consciousness (love of God)." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/3.txt/) May we deepen our understanding of Krsna's supremacy and cultivate a heart that is always ready to glorify Him.
