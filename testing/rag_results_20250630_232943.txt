REFERENCE: Bg. 16.9 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: etƒÅ·πÅ d·πõ·π£·π≠im ava·π£·π≠abhyana·π£·π≠ƒÅtmƒÅno ‚Äôlpa-buddhaya·∏•prabhavanty ugra-karmƒÅ·πáa·∏•k·π£ayƒÅya jagato ‚ÄôhitƒÅ·∏•

TRANSLATION: Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But according to Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.

TRANSLATION: In that place, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, who was lying in the womb of Devakƒ´, is now meditating.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The Lord is always situated in His spiritual potency, and the living entities are situated in their spiritual consciousness. This is the difference between the Lord and the living entities. The Lord is never affected by the material modes, whereas the living entities are always affected. Therefore, the Lord is always in a transcendental position, and the living entities are always in a relative position.

üïâ Understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead: SB 10.6.7

My dear devotee, let us delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada, as revealed in Srimad Bhagavatam 10.6.7. This verse and its purport offer a glimpse into the nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, and our own spiritual consciousness.

‚ú® The Lord's Meditation in the Womb of Devakƒ´

In this verse, we find K·πõ·π£·πáa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, meditating in the womb of Devakƒ´. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "In that place, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa, who was lying in the womb of Devakƒ´, is now meditating." [SB 10.6.7, Verse](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/6/7/)

‚ú® The Lord's Spiritual Potency

The purport of this verse reveals a crucial distinction between the Lord and the living entities. Srila Prabhupada writes, "The Lord is always situated in His spiritual potency..." [SB 10.6.7, Purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/6/7/) This means that the Lord is never affected by the material modes, whereas we, as living entities, are always influenced by them.

‚ú® Our Spiritual Consciousness

As Srila Prabhupada continues, "...and the living entities are situated in their spiritual consciousness." [SB 10.6.7, Purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/6/7/) This highlights the importance of cultivating our spiritual consciousness, which is inherently connected to the Lord's spiritual potency.

‚ú® The Difference Between the Lord and the Living Entities

The key difference between the Lord and the living entities lies in their relationship with the material modes. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "The Lord is never affected by the material modes, whereas the living entities are always affected." [SB 10.6.7, Purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/6/7/) This distinction is essential to understanding our spiritual journey and the importance of surrendering to the Lord's will.

‚ú® Reflection and Application

As we reflect on this verse and its purport, let us remember that our spiritual growth depends on our ability to connect with the Lord's spiritual potency. By cultivating our spiritual consciousness and surrendering to the Lord's will, we can transcend the material modes and experience the bliss of spiritual life.

In the words of Srila Prabhupada, "The Lord is always in a transcendental position, and the living entities are always in a relative position." [SB 10.6.7, Purport](https://vedabase.io/en/library/sb/10/6/7/) May we strive to understand and apply this fundamental principle in our daily lives, and thus deepen our connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K·πõ·π£·πáa.
