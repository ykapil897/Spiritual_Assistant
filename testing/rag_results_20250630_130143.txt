TEXT: one person king in one subject and another in another subject. This knowledge, however, is sovereign over all others, and all other knowledge is subject or relative to it. The word //rāja-guhyam// indicates that this sovereign knowledge is very confidential, and the word //pavitram// means that it is very pure. This knowledge is also //uttamam; ud// means "transcend," and //tama// means "darkness," and that knowledge which surpasses this world and the knowledge of this world is called //uttamam.// It is the knowledge of light, and darkness has been separated from it. If one follows this path of knowledge, he will personally understand how far he has progressed down the path of perfection (//pratyakṣāvagamaṁ dharmyam//). //Su-sukhaṁ kartum// indicates that this knowledge is very happy and joyful to execute. And //avyayam// indicates that this knowledge is permanent. We may work in this material world for education or riches, but these things are not //avyayam,// for as soon as this body is finished, everything else is also finished. With death, our education, advanced degrees, bank balances, family---everything---are all finished. Whatever we're doing in this material world is not eternal. However, this knowledge is not like that. {{page>books:bg:2:40#text}} **"In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear."** [[books:bg:2:40|(Bg. 2.40)]] Knowledge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so perfect that if one performs work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and yet does not attain perfection, in his next life he takes up from wherever he left off. In other words, actions performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are durable. On the other hand, material achievements, because they pertain to the body, are vanquished at death. Knowledge that pertains to designations does not endure. I am thinking that I am a man or a woman, an American or Indian, a Christian or Hindu---these are all designations pertaining to the body, and when the body is finished, they will also be finished. We are actually spirit, and therefore our spiritual activities will go with us wherever we go. Śrī Kṛṣṇa indicates that this king of knowledge is also happily performed. We can easily see that activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are joyfully done. There is chanting and dancing, eating //prasādam// (food that has been offered to Kṛṣṇa) and discussing //Bhagavad-gītā.// These

TEXT: to learn to follow this example. Of course Kṛṣṇa was present to tell Arjuna what his work was, but what about us? Śrī Kṛṣṇa was personally directing Arjuna to act in such and such a way, but just because Kṛṣṇa is not personally present before us, we should not assume that there is no direction. Indeed, there is direction. In the last chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// the proper work which we are to perform is given. > ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ > mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati > bhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā > mām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ > [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]] > > na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu > kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ > bhavitā na ca me tasmād > anyaḥ priyataro bhuvi > [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]] "For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me. There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be one more dear." (Bg. 18.68-69) It is therefore incumbent upon us to preach the method of //Bhagavad-gītā// and make people Kṛṣṇa conscious. People are actually suffering for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We should all engage in spreading the science of Kṛṣṇa for the benefit of the whole world. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu came with this mission of teaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and He said that regardless of one's position, if he teaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness he is to be considered a spiritual master. Both //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are filled with information on how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu selected these two books and requested that people in all corners of the world spread this science of Kṛṣṇa in every town and village. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was Kṛṣṇa Himself, and we should take this to be Kṛṣṇa's indication of our proper work. But we should be careful to present //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, without personal interpretation or motivation. Some people present interpretations of //Bhagavad-gītā,// but we should present the words as they are spoken by Śrī Kṛṣṇa. One who works for Kṛṣṇa may appear to be working like anyone else in the material world, but this is not the case. Arjuna may have fought just like an ordinary military man, but because he fought in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he was free from the entanglement of his activities.

REFERENCE: Raja-Vidya 5 (Raja-Vidya)

TEXT: Even scholars like Śaṅkarācārya, who have different opinions from the Personality of Godhead, admit that Kṛṣṇa is //svayaṁ bhagavān//---Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. Vedic knowledge is not a recent discovery. It is all old revealed knowledge. Kṛṣṇa refers to it as //purātanaḥ,// which means ancient. Kṛṣṇa says that millions of years before He spoke this //yoga// to the sun-god, and we do not know how many millions of years before that He spoke it to someone else. This knowledge is always being repeated, just as summer, autumn, winter and spring are repeated every year. Our fund of knowledge is very poor; we do not even know the history of this planet more than 5,000 years back, but the Vedic literatures give us histories extending millions of years ago. Just because we have no knowledge of what happened 3,000 years ago on this planet, we cannot conclude that there was no history then. Of course one can disclaim the historical validity of Kṛṣṇa. One may say that Kṛṣṇa, according to //Mahābhārata,// lived 5,000 years ago, and this being the case, there is no possibility of His having spoken //Bhagavad-gītā// to the sun god so many millions of years before. If I said that I gave a speech on the sun some millions of years ago to the sun-god, people would say, "Swāmījī is speaking some nonsense." But this is not the case with Kṛṣṇa, for He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whether we believe that Kṛṣṇa spoke //Bhagavad-gītā// to the sun-god or not, this fact is being accepted by Arjuna. Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord, and therefore he knew that it was quite possible for Kṛṣṇa to have spoken to someone millions of years before. Although Arjuna personally accepts the statements of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, in order to clarify the situation for people who would come after him, he asks: > aparaṁ bhavato janma > paraṁ janma vivasvataḥ > katham etad vijānīyāṁ > tvam ādau proktavān iti "The sun-god Vivasvān is senior by birth to You. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?" [[books:bg:4:4|(Bg. 4.4)]] Actually this is a very intelligent question, and Kṛṣṇa answers it in this way: > bahūni me vyatītāni > janmāni tava cārjuna > tāny ahaṁ veda sarvāṇi > na tvaṁ

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🕉 Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada 🕉

As we delve into the treasure trove of spiritual knowledge, Raja-Vidya, we are reminded of the immense contribution Srila Prabhupada has made to our understanding of the spiritual world.

✨ The Sovereignty of Spiritual Knowledge ✨

Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the supremacy of spiritual knowledge, stating, *"This knowledge, however, is sovereign over all others, and all other knowledge is subject or relative to it."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/1.txt/) This knowledge is not limited by time, space, or circumstances; it is eternal and all-encompassing.

✨ The Permanence of Spiritual Knowledge ✨

In contrast to the ephemeral nature of material pursuits, Srila Prabhupada reminds us that *"whatever we're doing in this material world is not eternal. However, this knowledge is not like that. ... actions performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness are durable."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/1.txt/) This durability is a hallmark of spiritual knowledge, which remains unaffected by the vicissitudes of the material world.

✨ The Importance of Spreading Kṛṣṇa Consciousness ✨

Srila Prabhupada stresses the urgency of sharing this knowledge with others, saying, *"It is therefore incumbent upon us to preach the method of Bhagavad-gītā and make people Kṛṣṇa conscious. People are actually suffering for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/8.txt/) By spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we can alleviate the suffering of others and bring them closer to the ultimate goal of life.

✨ The Ancient Nature of Vedic Knowledge ✨

Srila Prabhupada reminds us that Vedic knowledge is not a recent discovery, but rather *"all old revealed knowledge. Kṛṣṇa refers to it as purātanaḥ, which means ancient."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/5.txt/) This ancient wisdom has been passed down through the ages, providing a timeless and universal framework for spiritual growth.

✨ The Supreme Position of Kṛṣṇa ✨

Finally, Srila Prabhupada establishes the supreme position of Kṛṣṇa, citing even scholars like Śaṅkarācārya, who *"admit that Kṛṣṇa is svayaṁ bhagavān—Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/5.txt/) This understanding is fundamental to our spiritual journey, as it recognizes the ultimate authority and guidance of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

✨ Reflection ✨

As we reflect on these essential points from Raja-Vidya, we are reminded of the importance of prioritizing spiritual knowledge in our lives. By embracing this knowledge and sharing it with others, we can experience the durability and sovereignty of spiritual growth. Let us strive to deepen our understanding of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and spread it far and wide, for the benefit of all.
