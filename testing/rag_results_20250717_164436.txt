Among these, Mayavada Philosophy stands as a significant obstacle to genuine spiritual growth. Srila Prabhupada, the revered spiritual master, has illuminated the dangers of this philosophy, guiding us towards the path of authentic self-realization.

**The Perils of Mayavada Philosophy**

Srila Prabhupada warns us, "Mayavada philosophy is a dangerous philosophy. It is said that Lord Buddha, he preached Mayavada philosophy, that 'There is no soul. There is no God. Everything is void.' This is Mayavada philosophy." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/pqpa/0A.txt/)

[Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tlk/14.txt/)

Mayavada Philosophy misconstrues the nature of the Absolute Truth, considering it to be impersonal.
