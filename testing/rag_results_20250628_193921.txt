PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Any question that is put forward may be answered by quoting the authority, and that satisfies the saner section. That is the system even in the law court. The best lawyer gives evidence from the past judgment of the court without taking much trouble to establish his case. This is called the //paramparƒÅ// system, and learned authorities follow it without manufacturing rubbish interpretations.

REFERENCE: SB 3.5.15 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: O Maitreya, O friend of the distressed, the glories of the Supreme Lord can alone do good for people all over the world. Therefore, just as bees collect honey from flowers, kindly describe the essence of all topics---the topics of the Lord.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: There are many topics for different persons in different modes of material nature, but the essential topics are those in relationship with the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, materially affected conditioned souls are all more or less averse to topics of the Supreme Lord because some of them do not believe in the existence of God and some of them believe only in the impersonal feature of the Lord. In both cases there is nothing for them to say of God. Both the nonbelievers and the impersonalists deny the essence of all topics; therefore, they engage in topics of relativity in various ways, either in sense gratification or in mental speculation. For the pure devotees like Vidura, the topics of both the mundaners and the mental speculators are useless in all respects. Thus Vidura requested Maitreya to talk of the essence only, the talks of K·πõ·π£·πáa, and nothing else.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ The Power of the Holy Name: Unveiling the Mission of Lord Caitanya

My dear devotee, let us delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada, as revealed in Caitanya Caritamrta, Adi 12.14. Here, we find the essence of Lord Caitanya's mission and the significance of chanting the holy name of K·πõ·π£·πáa.

‚ú® The Mission of Lord Caitanya

As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently states, *"The mission of Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu is to spread k·πõ·π£·πáa-sa·πÖkƒ´rtana, or the chanting of the holy name of K·πõ·π£·πáa, all over the world."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt) This mission is not just a casual endeavor, but a deliberate attempt to awaken humanity to the transformative power of the holy name.

‚ú® The Holy Name: A Means to Spiritual Enlightenment

Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that *"the holy name of K·πõ·π£·πáa is the most powerful means of attaining spiritual enlightenment, and therefore ≈örƒ´ Caitanya MahƒÅprabhu, who is K·πõ·π£·πáa Himself, has brought this chanting process to this world."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt) This statement underscores the significance of the holy name as a means to attain spiritual perfection.

‚ú® The Easiest and Most Effective Way

In this age of Kali, we are fortunate to have the chanting of the holy name as a readily available means to attain spiritual perfection. As Srila Prabhupada explains, *"In this age of Kali, the easiest and most effective way to attain spiritual perfection is to chant the holy name of K·πõ·π£·πáa."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/12/14.txt) This simplicity and accessibility make the chanting of the holy name an unparalleled opportunity for spiritual growth.

‚ú® Reflection and Application

As we reflect on these teachings, let us remember that the chanting of the holy name is not just a mechanical process, but a heartfelt expression of our devotion to K·πõ·π£·πáa. By embracing this practice, we can experience the transformative power of the holy name and make progress on our spiritual journey. As Srila Prabhupada so often reminded us, the holy name is our greatest treasure, and by chanting it regularly, we can attain spiritual perfection and return to our eternal relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa.

May we take inspiration from Lord Caitanya's mission and make the chanting of the holy name an integral part of our daily lives.
