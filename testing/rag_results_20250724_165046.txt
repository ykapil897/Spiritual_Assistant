### The Role of Sense Gratification in Spiritual Life

**Prabhupāda:** The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other anarthas, drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. 

**Mr. Loomis:** Could I ask a question? I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not. 

**Prabhupāda:** Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, that kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10]. Sense gratification is required as far as..., as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification. Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest. But not that we shall sleep twenty-four hours or twenty hours and enjoy, as in this country sometimes they enjoy sleeping. But sleeping is wasting time. So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized. You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called tapasya, or advancement of spiritual life.

**Prabhupāda:** Eating, sleeping, sex and defense. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased. That is tapasya. In the human life this is possible, this is possible. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. One can conquer over these things, by practice. The more we minimize this āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna, this means we are advanced in spiritual taste.

**Prabhupāda:** It is practiced. My, my personal life, I don't sleep at night. And nowadays, at most, one hour. Yes. But I take rest in the daytime, at least two to three hours. So it is not that I am sleeping one hour. I sleep three to four hours total. But if practiced, it can be reduced, practiced. We see in the life of Gosvāmīs. About them, it is said: nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. They conquered over sleeping, eating. If we conquer over eating, then we can conquer over sleeping and other things also. If we can control over this tongue, then we can control over the other senses very easily. That is a fact. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre. Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent. So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the śāstra also it is said sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ [Brs. 1.2.234]. Our present senses are unable to understand śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi, the holy name of the Lord.

_Key Insight: Sense gratification is necessary but should be minimized to advance in spiritual life. By controlling the tongue, one can control the other senses and make spiritual progress._

### The Ideal Society and Spirituality

**Prabhupāda:** There is no purport of Devahūti?

**Nitāi:** "Here the word asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt is significant. Asat means 'impermanent,' 'temporary,' and indriya means 'senses.' Thus asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt means 'from being agitated by the temporarily manifest senses of the material body.' We are evolving through different statuses of material bodily existence---sometimes in a human body, sometimes in an animal body---and therefore the engagements of our material senses are also changing. Anything which changes is called temporary, or asat. We should know that beyond these temporary senses are our permanent senses, which are now covered by the material body. The permanent senses, being contaminated by matter, are not acting properly. Devotional service, therefore, involves freeing the senses from this contamination. When the contamination is completely removed and the senses act in the purity of unalloyed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we have reached the sad-indriya, or eternal sense activities. The eternal sensual activities are called devotional service, whereas temporary sensual activities are called sense gratification. Unless one becomes tired of material sense gratification, there is no opportunity to hear transcendental messages from a person like Kapila. Devahūti expressed that she was tired. Now that her husband had left home, she wanted to get relief by hearing the instructions of Lord Kapila."

**Prabhupāda:** So this full book is the answer and question between mother and son. So, although she is mother, she has given birth to the child, but she has become now dependent on this child for good instruction. This is ideal society.

_Key Insight: In an ideal society, even a mother can become dependent on her child for spiritual guidance, demonstrating a humble and open-minded approach to learning._

### Spiritual Advancement and Materialism

**Indian guest:** How do you advise Indians who are here and who have fallen to some extent in the materialistic world? They did not leave... Basically, they left their homes, most of them, to educate themselves. When they came here, they educated themselves, and they don't want to go back. Basically, they have fallen into the materialistic world. What advice you render them so that they get out of these clutches and go back and serve here or in the country, but they should be devotional to the Almighty God?

**Prabhupāda:** So there is no question of "here" and "there." You can become advanced in spiritual life anywhere if you follow the principles. That we are teaching. We are opening centers all over the world. You take the advantage of our teaching, our books, our center. Then it will be all right. They are following, these Europeans and American boys. They are young boys. They are giving up meat-eating. Do you give up meat-eating? Why Indians, you should learn meat-eating? They are giving up, and you are eating meat. This is the lesson, that these foreigners---they were accustomed to eat meat from the childhood---they are giving up, and you are eating meat. This is the instruction. Indians are drinking. They are giving up drinking. The lessons are already there. There is no question why. The lessons are already there, books are already there, the centers are already there.

_Key Insight: Spiritual advancement is possible anywhere, regardless of location, if one follows the principles and takes advantage of available resources, such as teachings, books, and centers._

### The Power of Tapasya

**Prabhupāda:** That is tapasya, means we should restrict sense gratification. Sense gratification, either regulated or nonregulated, is meant for animal life. Sense control is the human life. Therefore you'll find in Vedic culture big, big learned scholars, big, big kings, they dedicated their life for tapasya. **Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam** [SB 5.5.1]. If you want to purify your existence, then you must take to the process of tapasya. Tapo divyam. And what is that tapasya? Tapasya for realization of God. And then we shall be purified. 

**Prabhupāda:** What is the meaning of purify, purification? Purification means we are eternal, and if we become purified from this material contamination, then we get back our eternal life, back to home, back to Godhead. That is required. That is... For that we have to accept little tapasya. Not to become sense gratifier like the dogs and hogs. That is not civilization. **Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye** [SB 5.5.1]. 

**Prabhupāda:** This human life should be regulated in such a way that he hasn't got to satisfy the senses after taking so much hard labor. The modern civilization is like that. Everyone is engaged in hard labor simply for satisfaction of the senses. So they have become mad. **Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vi...** And they are acting without any consideration of the effect. They do not consider whether it is sinful or not. They do not believe in the next life. They do not discriminate what is sinful, what is pious---nothing. Exactly like animals. So śāstra says, "This is not good." Here also, Devahūti says that **bhūmann asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt. Asad-indriya-tarṣ...** 

**Prabhupāda:** Actually, these senses are not real senses. It is covered, just like my this body, covered with this shirt or this cloth. It is not my real body. Although you see the shirt has got a hand, that hand is not real hand. The real hand is within the shirt. Similarly, our real body is within this body. **Dehino 'smin yathā dehe** [Bg. 2.13]. **Dehinaḥ. Dehinaḥ** means the real body, or the spiritual body of the soul, is within this body. **Dehino 'smin yathā dehe.** And the body is changing. **Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.** It is sometimes child, sometimes youth, sometimes a young man, sometimes old man. And then vanishes. It is... There are six changes. So this is not real body. 

**Prabhupāda:** But... And we are engaged in this unreal body, sense gratification. We have got senses. So therefore **Bhagavad-gītā** says, **sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam** [Bg. 6.21]. **Atīndriya-grāhyam.** Beyond the senses. Therefore these senses are to be purified. That is called tapasya. **Tapo divyam** [SB 5.5.1]. And... Yes. **Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.** When we purify our senses... Senses you cannot destroy. That is not possible. Just like some..., somebody said that "You become desireless." Desireless... Desire is the mental activities. So we cannot be desireless. That is not possible. We have to purify the desire. That is required. That is recommended, **sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate** [Cc. Madhya 19.170].

_Key Insight:_ Tapasya, or sense control, is essential for human life to purify our existence and get back to our eternal life, back to Godhead.

### The Illusion of Sense Gratification

**Prabhupāda:** The whole structure of our body means the senses. We are, everyone, animal and less intelligent men, busy only for sense gratification. They think sense gratification is enjoyment, happiness. But actually, that is not happiness. Sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyam (Bg. 6.21). What is actual happiness, ātyantikam, that is atīndriya. Atīndriya means beyond the senses.

**Prabhupāda:** But because we have no such knowledge, because we are in the bodily concept of life, "I am this body," so I am interested in the matter of gratifying my senses. Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhuḥ. And those who are a little advanced, they are in the enjoyment of the mind, mental speculation, philosophy or theosophy. So many "sophies" are there---somebody putting some theories, this theory, that theory, that theory. Mental speculation. They derive poetry, writing poetry, nice poetry. They are not on the gross platform of sense gratification but on the subtle platform of sense... Mind is also sense. Mind is also sense.

**Prabhupāda:** Kṛṣṇa says in the Bhagavad-gītā, bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā (Bg. 7.4): "These eight elements, they are also My prakṛti, but bhinnā, separated, separated prakṛti." Prakṛti means subordinate to the puruṣa. As soon as the prakṛti... Generally, we understand that the husband and wife, wife is called prakṛti, and the husband is called puruṣa. So puruṣa means enjoyer, and prakṛti means enjoyed. So similarly, when Kṛṣṇa says, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā, that all these elements, gross and subtle---earth, water, air, fire, and these are gross elements, and the mind, intelligence and ego, subtle elements...

**Prabhupāda:** Then Kṛṣṇa says, apareyam: "These elements are inferior prakṛti." Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām. There is another prakṛti. What is that? Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat (Bg. 7.5). Jīva-bhūta, the living entity. The living entity is also prakṛti. We are not puruṣa. But we forget this. Prakṛti means to be used by the puruṣa. Therefore our position is, real position is, we should be used by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, puruṣa, Puruṣottama. This is our position. But artificially we are trying to become the puruṣa. That is māyā. Instead of being utilized by the puruṣa, we are trying to become the puruṣa, to utilize the material nature. Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat. The world is going on, the material world, because the living entities in the attitude of becoming puruṣa, they are trying to exploit the resources of this material nature.

**Prabhupāda:** This is our material disease. And how we are trying to be master or enjoyer of this material world? By the senses, by the mind. Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhāni prakṛti-sthāni karṣati. Manaḥ... Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ (Bg. 15.7). "The living entities," Kṛṣṇa says, "they are My part and parcel." So instead of serving Kṛṣṇa, they are trying to..., utilizing, they are trying to utilize the material nature for their sense gratification. This is called struggle for existence, prakṛti-sthāni karṣati. Karṣati means hard struggle.

_Key Insight:_ _True happiness lies beyond sense gratification, and our real position is to be utilized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to try to become the enjoyer of the material world._

### The Futility of Artificial Sense Control

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore, the so-called yogis, fifteen minutes meditation or, say, fifteen hours meditation, or fifteen months meditation, but as soon as meditation finished—sense gratification. That's all. So this sense gratification program is very strong. And so long you will indulge in sense gratification, the repetition of birth and death will go on.

**Prabhupāda:** The repetition of birth. This body... The Bhāgavata says that these people are working for sense gratification. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ means mad after sense gratification. Kurute vikarma. And for sense gratification, they are acting so abominably that it is not to be uttered. Kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti. They have engaged their life in sense gratification. Na sādhu manye, oh this is not good. This is not good. Why? Yata, because, ātmanaḥ, the spirit soul, ātmano 'yam... Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB 5.5.4]. This body is temporary, but so long this body is there, you'll have to suffer. What is that suffering? The sum total of suffering is birth, death, old age and disease. This is due to this body.

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore, the problem is how to stop this material body, repetition. Today I have got this body, Indian, tomorrow I may get American, next birth... Tomorrow means next birth. Next birth another, next birth another, next birth another—it is going on. Going on. There is no stoppage, this transmigration of the soul. But so long you do not stop it, there is no question of being freed from sufferings. They do not know it. They are thinking they are advancing. What advancement you have made? These sufferings are there—birth, death, old age and disease. You cannot stop it. Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ, and even you go to this moon planet or to the highest planet, these four things will follow.

**Prabhupāda:** So, therefore, sense gratification must be stopped. But if you want to stop it artificially, it is impossible. Neither by this yoga process, neither by this jñāna process. Simply for the time being you can check. Just like a naughty boy. By force, you can stop him acting mischievously. But as soon as he gets opportunity, again he will act so. Similarly, senses are very strong. You cannot stop them artificially. Therefore, the only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Prabhupāda:** These boys in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this is also sense gratification, eating nice prasāda, dancing, chanting, reading philosophy—but it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa. That is the significance. Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe. It is the sense gratification of Kṛṣṇa. Not directly, but because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, my senses are automatically satisfied. This process should be adopted. Artificially... This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an art of living by which you will feel your senses are fully satisfied, but you are going to be free next life. This is the nice process.

**Prabhupāda:** And artificially if you want to stop your senses, you will fail. That Kṛṣṇa says, "One who restrains the sense and organs of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects." Just like Viśvāmitra Muni. There were many instances. He was a great king and he wanted to be yogi. And he went to forest, gave up his kingdom, went to forest.

_Key Insight:_ _Artificial attempts to control the senses are futile, and only Kṛṣṇa consciousness can bring true satisfaction and liberation from the cycle of birth and death._

### The Role of Sense Gratification in Spiritual Life

**Prabhupāda:** The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other anarthas, drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. 

**Mr. Loomis:** Could I ask a question? I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not. 

**Prabhupāda:** Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, that kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10]. Sense gratification is required as far as..., as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification. Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest.

So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized. You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called tapasya, or advancement of spiritual life.

**Prabhupāda:** Eating, sleeping, sex and defense. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased.

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre. Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent. So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the śāstra also it is said sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ [Brs. 1.2.234]. Our present senses are unable to understand śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi, the holy name of the Lord.

_Key Insight: Sense gratification is necessary but should be minimized to advance in spiritual life. By controlling the tongue, one can control the other senses and make spiritual progress._

But artificially we are trying to become the puruṣa. That is māyā. Instead of being utilized by the puruṣa, we are trying to become the puruṣa, to utilize the material nature. Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat. The world is going on, the material world, because the living entities in the attitude of becoming puruṣa, they are trying to exploit the resources of this material nature.

**Prabhupāda:** This is our material disease. And how we are trying to be master or enjoyer of this material world? By the senses, by the mind. Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhāni prakṛti-sthāni karṣati. Manaḥ... Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ (Bg. 15.7). "The living entities," Kṛṣṇa says, "they are My part and parcel." So instead of serving Kṛṣṇa, they are trying to..., utilizing, they are trying to utilize the material nature for their sense gratification. This is called struggle for existence, prakṛti-sthāni karṣati. Karṣati means hard struggle.

_Key Insight:_ _True happiness lies beyond sense gratification, and our real position is to be utilized by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, not to try to become the enjoyer of the material world._

### The Futility of Artificial Sense Control

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore, the so-called yogis, fifteen minutes meditation or, say, fifteen hours meditation, or fifteen months meditation, but as soon as meditation finished—sense gratification. That's all. So this sense gratification program is very strong. And so long you will indulge in sense gratification, the repetition of birth and death will go on.

**Prabhupāda:** The repetition of birth. This body... The Bhāgavata says that these people are working for sense gratification. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ means mad after sense gratification. Kurute vikarma. And for sense gratification, they are acting so abominably that it is not to be uttered. Kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti. They have engaged their life in sense gratification. Na sādhu manye, oh this is not good. This is not good. Why? Yata, because, ātmanaḥ, the spirit soul, ātmano 'yam... Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ [SB 5.5.4]. This body is temporary, but so long this body is there, you'll have to suffer. What is that suffering? The sum total of suffering is birth, death, old age and disease. This is due to this body.

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore, the problem is how to stop this material body, repetition. Today I have got this body, Indian, tomorrow I may get American, next birth... Tomorrow means next birth. Next birth another, next birth another, next birth another—it is going on. Going on. There is no stoppage, this transmigration of the soul. But so long you do not stop it, there is no question of being freed from sufferings. They do not know it. They are thinking they are advancing. What advancement you have made? These sufferings are there—birth, death, old age and disease. You cannot stop it. Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ, and even you go to this moon planet or to the highest planet, these four things will follow.

**Prabhupāda:** So, therefore, sense gratification must be stopped. But if you want to stop it artificially, it is impossible. Neither by this yoga process, neither by this jñāna process. Simply for the time being you can check. Just like a naughty boy. By force, you can stop him acting mischievously. But as soon as he gets opportunity, again he will act so. Similarly, senses are very strong. You cannot stop them artificially. Therefore, the only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Prabhupāda:** These boys in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this is also sense gratification, eating nice prasāda, dancing, chanting, reading philosophy—but it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa. That is the significance. Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe. It is the sense gratification of Kṛṣṇa. Not directly, but because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, my senses are automatically satisfied. This process should be adopted. Artificially... This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an art of living by which you will feel your senses are fully satisfied, but you are going to be free next life. This is the nice process.

**Prabhupāda:** And artificially if you want to stop your senses, you will fail. That Kṛṣṇa says, "One who restrains the sense and organs of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects." Just like Viśvāmitra Muni. There were many instances. He was a great king and he wanted to be yogi. And he went to forest, gave up his kingdom, went to forest.

_Key Insight:_ _Artificial attempts to control the senses are futile, and only Kṛṣṇa consciousness can bring true satisfaction and liberation from the cycle of birth and death._
