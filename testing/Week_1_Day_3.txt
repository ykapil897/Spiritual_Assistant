### 📖 The Highest Type of Religious Performance

**Prabhupāda:** This life of spiritual execution cannot be hampered by any material condition. From Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam we understand that **sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje** — *SB 1.2.6*. That is the highest type of religious performances by which one can achieve the perfection of loving God. **Bhakti** means to offer transcendental loving service to the Supreme Lord. **Bhaj-dhātu sevayā**. **Bhaj**. **Bhaj-dhātu**, it is a verb, **bhaj**. **Bhaj** means to render service just like servant renders service to the master, friend renders service to the friend, wife renders service to the husband, husband renders service to the wife. This service-rendering process is going on everywhere. Nobody is absolute that he does not render service to anyone. That is not possible. I have repeatedly explained that if somebody has no master to serve, he voluntarily accepts a cat or dog as his master to serve. The nice name is pet dog, but it is serving. The mother serves the child. So one who has no child, he takes the cat as her child and serves. So the service mood is going on everywhere. But the highest perfection of service is when we learn to serve the Supreme Absolute Lord. That is called **bhakti**. And that **bhakti** execution of service to the Lord is **ahaitukī**. Just like we have got some little examples. This mother is serving the child not with any expectation. She loves to serve the child. She wants to see the child is in comfort, the child does not feel any discomfiture. That is her pleasure. There is no reason why she is loving. That is natural. Similarly, when we invoke our natural love for God, that is the highest perfection of religious principle. **Ahaituky apratihatā**. **Apratihatā** means it cannot be checked by any material condition. Just like we want to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; this is service. This is the beginning of service, chanting the glories of the Lord, or praying the Lord, "Hare, O the energy of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa, O Lord, please engage me in Your service." This is the prayer. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, repeatedly, "Please engage me. Please engage me." But God can give you many things. Whatever you want, He is giving. **Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante** — *Bg. 4.11*. He can give you even salvation, but very rarely He gives you the chance of serving Him. So service is not an ordinary thing. So this is, this service is unimpaired, unchecked by any material condition. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he gives us some definition how you can be completely independent to serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

SHLOKA:

**cīrāṇi kiṁ pathi na santi diśanti bhikṣāṁ**
**naivāṅghripāḥ para-bhṛtaḥ sarito 'py aśuṣyan**
**ruddhā guhāḥ kim ajito 'vati nopasannān**
**kasmād bhajanti kavayo dhana-durmadāndhān**
— *SB 2.2.5*

*Key Insight: The highest perfection of service is when we learn to serve the Supreme Absolute Lord with natural, unconditional love.*

---

### 📖 Independence in Serving the Lord

**Prabhupāda:** Now our problem is eating-sleeping. Eating-sleeping. After sleeping, there is mating or fearing. These are the problems of bodily demands. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī recommends for a serious devotee, he says, **cīrāṇi kiṁ pathi na santi**.

*Key Insight: A serious devotee must learn to overcome bodily demands to become completely independent in serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.*
