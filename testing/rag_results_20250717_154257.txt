5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Sri Guru-vandana**

**Srimad-Bhagavatam 9.5.6: The Cycle of Birth and Death**

**The Importance of Hearing about the Lord's Pastimes**

In the sacred scripture, Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is stated:

"One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one must take birth again. Therefore, the cycle of birth and death continues, and the living entity is perpetually suffering. But one who is highly fortunate gets the opportunity to hear about the Lord's pastimes." (SB 9.5.6, Translation) [1]

Here, Srila Prabhupada reveals the fundamental predicament of the living entity in the material world. Birth and death are inevitable, and the cycle of samsara continues unabated. However, there is a way to break free from this cycle.

**The Cycle of Birth and Death**

As Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport:

"The living entity is perpetually suffering, and the cycle of birth and death continues. This is the material world." (SB 9.5.6, Purport) [1]

In this material world, the living entity is trapped in the cycle of birth and death, perpetually suffering due to the influence of the three modes of nature. But there is hope for liberation.

**The Importance of Devotional Service**

Srila Prabhupada further elucidates:

"But one who is highly fortunate gets the opportunity to hear about the Lord's pastimes, and thus he can get out of the cycle of birth and death and attain the lotus feet of the Lord." (SB 9.5.6, Purport) [1]

Here, Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the significance of devotional service, particularly hearing about the Lord's pastimes. This is the key to breaking free from the cycle of birth and death and attaining the ultimate goal of human life: love of Godhead.

**Practical Application**

As neophyte devotees, we should take advantage of this opportunity to hear about the Lord's pastimes and engage in devotional service. By doing so, we can gradually become free from the cycle of birth and death and attain the lotus feet of the Lord. Let us take shelter of Srila Prabhupada's teachings and make a sincere effort to hear about the Lord's pastimes, thereby advancing on the path of devotional service.
