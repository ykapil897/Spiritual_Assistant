REFERENCE: SB 7.6.17 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: My dear friends, O sons of the demons, it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been able to liberate himself from material bondage at any time or in any country. Rather, those bereft of knowledge of the Lord are bound by the material laws. They are factually addicted to sense gratification, and their target is woman. Indeed, they are actually playthings in the hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa is liberation from the bondage of material existence.

TRANSLATION: The sons of the demons replied: Dear PrahlƒÅda, neither you nor we know any teacher or spiritual master other than ·π¢a·πá·∏ça and Amarka, the sons of ≈öukrƒÅcƒÅrya. After all, we are children and they our controllers. For you especially, who always remain within the palace, it is very difficult to associate with a great personality. Dear friend, most gentle one, would you kindly explain how it was possible for you to hear NƒÅrada? Kindly dispel our doubts in this regard.

REFERENCE: SB 7.6.25 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Nothing is unobtainable for devotees who have satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all causes, the original source of everything. The Lord is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities. For devotees, therefore, who are transcendental to the modes of material nature, what is the use of following the principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, which are all automatically obtainable under the influence of the modes of nature? We devotees always glorify the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore we need not ask for anything in terms of dharma, kƒÅma, artha and mok·π£a.

REFERENCE: SB 7.6.24 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Therefore, my dear young friends born of demons, please act in such a way that the Supreme Lord, who is beyond the conception of material knowledge, will be satisfied. Give up your demoniac nature and act without enmity or duality. Show mercy to all living entities by enlightening them in devotional service, thus becoming their well-wishers.

REFERENCE: SB 7.6.19 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: My dear sons of demons, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, NƒÅrƒÅya·πáa, is the original Supersoul, the father of all living entities. Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing Him or worshiping Him under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man. The relationship between the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a fact, and therefore there is no difficulty in pleasing the Lord.

5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Pleasing Lord Krishna: A Devotee's Guide

As we embark on the journey to please Lord Krishna, it's essential to understand what truly resonates with Him. Srila Prabhupada's teachings offer valuable insights into this quest, and today, we'll explore three key aspects that bring joy to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

‚ú® Satisfying the Lord's Heart

When we've satisfied Lord Krishna, we don't need to ask for anything in terms of *dharma* (religion), *kƒÅma* (sense gratification), *artha* (wealth), and *mok·π£a* (liberation). As Srila Prabhupada explains, "We devotees always glorify the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore we need not ask for anything in terms of dharma, kƒÅma, artha and mok·π£a." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/7/6/25.txt)

This means that when we focus on pleasing Krishna, our material desires and needs are automatically taken care of. We can let go of our attachment to worldly pursuits and simply concentrate on serving the Lord.

‚ú® Overcoming Demoniac Nature

To truly please Lord Krishna, we must give up our *demoniac nature*, characterized by enmity and duality. Instead, we should show mercy to all living entities by enlightening them in devotional service. As Srila Prabhupada advises, "Give up your demoniac nature and act without enmity or duality. Show mercy to all living entities by enlightening them in devotional service, thus becoming their well-wishers." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/7/6/24.txt)

This means we should strive to be kind, compassionate, and understanding towards all beings, recognizing that they are also part of the Lord's creation.

‚ú® No Impediments to Pleasing Krishna

The good news is that there are no impediments to pleasing Lord Krishna, regardless of our age or condition. As Srila Prabhupada reassures us, "Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing the Lord or worshiping Him under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/7/6/19.txt)

This means that anyone, at any stage of life, can develop a loving relationship with Krishna and please Him through devotional service.

‚ú® Reflection

In conclusion, pleasing Lord Krishna is not about achieving material success or fulfilling our desires. It's about surrendering to His will, giving up our demoniac nature, and showing mercy to all living entities. By following these principles, we can develop a deep and loving relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and that's
