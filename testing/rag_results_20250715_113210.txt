üïâ Honoring Srila Prabhupada's Guidance

Dear devotee, let's embark on a journey to understand the essence of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as revealed by Srila Prabhupada's teachings.

‚ú® Who is Krishna?

**Krishna: The Supreme Personality of Godhead**

Srila Prabhupada unequivocally states, *"Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the verdict of the Vedic literature."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/pqpa/5.txt/)

This fundamental understanding is the foundation of Krishna consciousness. Krishna is not just a historical figure or a mythological character; He is the ultimate reality, the source of everything.

‚ú® The Ultimate Goal of Life

Srila Prabhupada further clarifies, *"The ultimate goal of life is to understand Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/bbd/4.txt/)

This means that our life's purpose is not just to exist or enjoy temporary pleasures, but to reconnect with Krishna, our eternal Lord and friend.

‚ú® All-Attractive, All-Knowing, and All-Powerful

Srila Prabhupada describes Krishna as *"the all-attractive, all-knowing, and all-powerful Supreme Personality of Godhead."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/nod/8.txt/)

Imagine a being who is infinitely attractive, possessing unparalleled knowledge, and wielding unimaginable power. This is Krishna, the Supreme Lord, who is beyond human comprehension.

**Reflection**

As we begin to grasp the magnitude of Krishna's personality, we can't help but feel a sense of awe and reverence. Srila Prabhupada's teachings invite us to deepen our understanding of Krishna, the ultimate goal of life. Let us take a moment to reflect on our own relationship with Krishna and strive to cultivate a more intimate connection with Him.

May Srila Prabhupada's guidance illuminate our path, and may we come closer to understanding the infinite beauty of Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
