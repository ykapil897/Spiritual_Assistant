REFERENCE: Bg. 16.9 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: etƒÅ·πÅ d·πõ·π£·π≠im ava·π£·π≠abhyana·π£·π≠ƒÅtmƒÅno ‚Äôlpa-buddhaya·∏•prabhavanty ugra-karmƒÅ·πáa·∏•k·π£ayƒÅya jagato ‚ÄôhitƒÅ·∏•

TRANSLATION: Following such conclusions, the demoniac, who are lost to themselves and who have no intelligence, engage in unbeneficial, horrible works meant to destroy the world.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction. The Lord states here that they are less intelligent. The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But according to Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense. They try to enjoy this material world to the utmost limit and therefore always engage in inventing something for sense gratification. Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings. They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world.

5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Understanding the Demoniac Nature: A Threat to Humanity

My dear devotee, let us take a moment to reflect on the wisdom of Srila Prabhupada, who has so graciously guided us in understanding the Bhagavad Gita and its relevance to modern society.

‚ú® The Demoniac Mindset

In Bhagavad Gita 16.9, Srila Prabhupada reveals the nature of demoniac people, who are engaged in activities that lead to world destruction. As he so eloquently puts it, *"The demoniac are engaged in activities that will lead the world to destruction."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/16/9.txt)

These individuals, driven by their materialistic desires, are devoid of sense and intelligence. Srila Prabhupada explains, *"The materialists, who have no concept of God, think that they are advancing. But according to Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ, they are unintelligent and devoid of all sense."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/16/9.txt)

‚ú® The Consequences of Materialistic Inventions

The demoniac mindset leads to the creation of materialistic inventions that ultimately result in violence, cruelty, and destruction. Srila Prabhupada warns us, *"Such materialistic inventions are considered to be advancement of human civilization, but the result is that people grow more and more violent and more and more cruel, cruel to animals and cruel to other human beings."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/16/9.txt)

A striking example of this demoniac activity is the invention of nuclear weapons. As Srila Prabhupada notes, *"Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/16/9.txt)

‚ú® Reflection and Application

As we reflect on these words of wisdom, let us recognize the importance of cultivating a spiritual mindset, one that is guided by the principles of the Bhagavad Gita. Let us strive to avoid the pitfalls of materialism and instead focus on developing our inner wisdom and compassion.

In our daily lives, let us be mindful of the consequences of our actions and the impact they have on the world around us. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more peaceful and harmonious society, one that is guided by the principles of love, kindness, and wisdom.

May we take heed of Srila Prabhupada's warnings and strive to become instruments of positive change in the world.
