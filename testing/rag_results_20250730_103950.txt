### 📖 Introduction to Kṛṣṇa Consciousness

**Prabhupāda:** Founder-ācārya of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.

**Brahmānanda:** All about preaching.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** In other words, a devotee can use this book to learn these verses which substantiate the following points.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** These are the points. "3] Preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest welfare activity. 4] Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be distributed to everyone, without restriction."

**Prabhupāda:** How many copies?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** This was printed strictly for the devotees, two thousand copies only. It's meant as like a preaching weapon.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** "5] One who preaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness is dear to Lord Kṛṣṇa and is protected by the Lord. 6] Kṛṣṇa empowers the preacher. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement spreads by the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya. 7] Preaching is based on compassion. 8] The preacher should practice tolerance. 9] To be effective in preaching, the preacher must be pure and follow the regulative principles. 10] Conditioned souls benefit from hearing Vedic literature, **kṛṣṇa-kathā**. 11] The future of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement."

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** The future of this Movement? Page 88. "The future of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement can save the world.

SHLOKA:

**Kirāta, Hūṇāndhra, Pulinda, Pulkaśa, Ābhīra, Śumbha, Yavana**  
— *SB 2.4.18*

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:** Purport: 'The above-mentioned historical names are different nations of the world. Even those who are constantly engaged in sinful acts are all corrigible to the standard of perfect human beings if they take shelter of the devotees of the Lord. Jesus Christ and Hajrat Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on the behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe. And from the version of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of the world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the Almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world, because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general.'

*Key Insight: The Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement has the power to save the world and bring about a thorough change of heart in human beings.*
