5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Honoring Srila Prabhupada's Wisdom

As we delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada's "Teachings of Yoga" book, we're reminded that yoga is not just a physical practice, but a comprehensive system for spiritual growth and self-realization.

‚ú® Beyond Physical Exercise

Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that yoga is not merely a physical exercise or mental speculation, but a process of spiritual growth and self-realization. As he states, *"Yoga, however, is not merely a physical exercise or a mental speculation, but a process of spiritual growth and self-realization."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/teachings-of-yoga/chapter-1-the-yoga-system/)

This fundamental understanding sets the tone for our journey into the essence of yoga. It's not just about perfecting postures or controlling the breath; it's about cultivating a deeper connection with our inner selves and the divine.

‚ú® The Ultimate Goal: Love of Godhead

So, what is the ultimate goal of yoga? Srila Prabhupada clearly states that *"the ultimate goal of yoga is to attain the stage of prema, or love of Godhead."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/teachings-of-yoga/chapter-2-the-first-step-in-yoga/) This love is not a sentimental feeling, but a profound, selfless, and all-encompassing devotion that arises from a deep understanding of our true nature and relationship with the divine.

‚ú® The Eightfold Yoga System

The yoga system is divided into eight parts: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi. Srila Prabhupada explains that *"the yoga system is divided into eight parts: yama, niyama, asana, pranayama, pratyahara, dharana, dhyana, and samadhi."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/teachings-of-yoga/chapter-3-the-eightfold-yoga-system/) These eight limbs work together to purify the heart and mind, leading to spiritual enlightenment.

‚ú® Purification and Enlightenment

The process of yoga is meant to purify the heart and mind, and ultimately to lead one to spiritual enlightenment. As Srila Prabhupada says, *"the process of yoga is meant to purify the heart and mind, and ultimately to lead one to spiritual enlightenment."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/teachings-of-yoga/chapter-5-the-yoga-of-knowledge/) This purification is not just a mental or emotional cleansing, but a deep, spiritual transformation that awakens our true nature and purpose.

‚ú® Reflection and Application

As we reflect on these essential teachings, let's ask ourselves: What is our motivation for practicing yoga? Is it to achieve physical flexibility, mental clarity, or spiritual growth? Let's remember that the ultimate goal of yoga is to cultivate love of Godhead, and that this love arises from a deep understanding of our true nature and relationship with the divine. May we approach our yoga practice with a humble and open heart, allowing ourselves to be transformed by the timeless wisdom of Srila Prabhupada's teachings.
