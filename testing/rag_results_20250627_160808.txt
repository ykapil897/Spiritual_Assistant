REFERENCE: SB 3.1.4 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Saint Vidura was a great and pure devotee of the Lord, and therefore his questions to His Grace Ṛṣi Maitreya must have been very purposeful, on the highest level, and approved by learned circles.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Questions and answers among different classes of men have different value. Inquiries by mercantile men in a business exchange cannot be expected to be highly purposeful in spiritual values. Questions and answers by different classes of men can be guessed by the caliber of the persons concerned. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// the discussion was between Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, the Supreme Person and the supreme devotee respectively. The Lord admitted Arjuna to be His devotee and friend [[books:bg:4:3|(Bg. 4.3)]], and therefore any sane man can guess that the discussion was on the topic of the //bhakti-yoga// system. Actually the whole //Bhagavad-gītā// is based on the principle of //bhakti-yoga.// There is a difference between //karma// and //karma-yoga. Karma// is regulated action for the enjoyment of the fruit by the performer, but //karma-yoga// is action performed by the devotee for the satisfaction of the Lord. //Karma-yoga// is based on //bhakti,// or pleasing the Lord, whereas //karma// is based on pleasing the senses of the performer himself. According to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// one is advised to approach a bona fide spiritual master when one is actually inclined to question from an elevated level of spiritual understanding. A common man who has no interest in spiritual values has no need to approach a spiritual master just as a matter of following fashion.

As a student, Mahārāja Parīkṣit was serious about learning the science of God, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī was a bona fide spiritual master in the transcendental science. Both of them knew that the topics discussed by Vidura and Ṛṣi Maitreya were elevated, and thus Mahārāja Parīkṣit was very interested in learning from the bona fide spiritual master.

REFERENCE: SB 1.7.13 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: When the respective warriors of both camps, namely the Kauravas and the Pāṇḍavas, were killed on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and the dead warriors obtained their deserved destinations, and when the son of Dhṛtarāṣṭra fell down lamenting, his spine broken, being beaten by the club of Bhīmasena, the son of Droṇācārya [Aśvatthāmā] beheaded the five sleeping sons of Draupadī and delivered them as a prize to his master, foolishly thinking that he would be pleased. Duryodhana, however, disapproved of the heinous act, and he was not pleased in the least.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Transcendental topics of the activities of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// begin from the end of the battle at Kurukṣetra, where the Lord Himself spoke about Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Therefore, both the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are transcendental topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The //Gītā// is //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// or topics of Kṛṣṇa, because it is spoken by the Lord, and the //Bhāgavatam// is also //kṛṣṇa-kathā// because it is spoken about the Lord. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted everyone to be informed of both //kṛṣṇa-kathās// by His order. Lord Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is Kṛṣṇa Himself in the garb of a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore the versions of both Lord Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu are identical. //Lord Caitanya desired that all who are born in India seriously understand such kṛṣṇa-kathās// and then after full realization preach the transcendental message to everyone in all parts of the world. That will bring about the desired peace and prosperity of the stricken world.

REFERENCE: CC Adi 8.36 (Sri Caitanya-caritamrta)



TRANSLATION: By reading Śrī Caitanya-maṅgala one can understand all the glories and truths of Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda and come to the ultimate conclusion of devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: //Śrīmad-Bhagavatam// is the authoritative reference book from which to understand devotional service, but because it is very elaborate, few men can understand its purpose. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the original commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra,// which is called //nyāya-prasthāna.// It was written to enable one to understand the Absolute Truth through infallible logic and argument, and therefore its natural commentary, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// is extremely elaborate. Professional reciters have created the impression that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// deals only with Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā,// although Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā// is described only in the Tenth Canto (chapters 29-35). They have in this way presented Kṛṣṇa to the Western world as a great woman-hunter, and therefore we sometimes have to deal with such misconceptions in preaching. Another difficulty in understanding //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is that the professional reciters have introduced //bhāgavata-saptāha,// or seven-day readings of the //Bhāgavatam.// They want to finish //Śrīmad-Bhagavatam// in a week, although it is so sublime that even one verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// if properly explained, cannot be completed in three months. Under these circumstances, it is a great aid for the common man to read Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura's //Caitanya-bhāgavata,// for thus he can actually understand devotional service, Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said:

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpātāyaiva kalpate

"Devotional service to the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic scriptures like the //Upaniṣads, Purāṇas, Nārada-pañcarātra,// etc., is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society." Due to misunderstanding //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// people are misled regarding the science of Kṛṣṇa. However, by reading Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura's book one can very easily understand this science.

🕉 Understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna

My dear devotee, let us dive into the ocean of knowledge and explore the teachings of our beloved Srila Prabhupada, who has so mercifully revealed the glories of Lord Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

In the Bhagavad-gita, Srila Prabhupada explains that the entire scripture is based on the principle of bhakti-yoga. As he states in the purport of SB 3.1.4, *"The whole Bhagavad-gītā is based on the principle of bhakti-yoga."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/1/4.txt) This fundamental principle is the foundation upon which our understanding of Lord Krsna is built.

Both the Bhagavad-gita and Srimad Bhagavatam are considered transcendental topics of Lord Krsna. In the purport of SB 1.7.13, Srila Prabhupada clarifies, *"Therefore, both the Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam are transcendental topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/1/7/13-14.txt) These scriptures are not ordinary books, but rather a window into the spiritual realm, revealing the glories of the Supreme Lord.

✨ The Authoritative Reference for Devotional Service

Srimad Bhagavatam is not just a transcendental topic, but also the authoritative reference book for understanding devotional service to Lord Krsna. As Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport of CC Adi 8.36, *"Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the authoritative reference book from which to understand devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/8/36.txt) This scripture is our guide, our mentor, and our friend on the path of devotional service.

✨ Conclusion: The Supreme Personality of Godhead

In conclusion, my dear devotee, we can confidently say that Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as revealed in the scriptures and confirmed by Srila Prabhupada's teachings. By understanding the principles of bhakti-yoga, transcendental topics, and the authoritative reference of Srimad Bhagavatam, we can deepen our appreciation for Lord Krsna's supreme position.

Let us reflect on these teachings and strive to cultivate a deeper love and devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna.
