5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Invocation**

om tad visnoh paramam padam sada
pasyanti surayah diviva caksur yat
tat paramam mama

"O my Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are situated in the hearts of all living entities, just like the sun is situated in the sky, and who are the ultimate goal of the Vedas." (Srimad-Bhagavatam 1.1.1)

**The Transcendental Position of the Devotee**

In the ninth canto, fifth chapter, and sixth verse of Srimad-Bhagavatam, it is stated:

**The Devotee's Freedom from Material Nature**

"A devotee, therefore, is not affected by the material modes of nature, for he is situated in the transcendental position of the Lord." (SB 9.5.6, Purport) [1]

This verse highlights the unique position of a devotee, who, by virtue of their connection with the Lord, is not influenced by the three modes of material nature: sattva, rajas, and tamas. A devotee's consciousness is situated in the transcendental realm, beyond the reach of material nature's influence.

**The Devotee's Freedom from Karma**

Furthermore, the Lord's devotees are not bound by the reactions of their past activities. As Srila Prabhupada explains in the translation of SB 9.5.6:

"One who has taken his birth is undoubtedly going to die, and one who has died is sure to take birth again. Therefore, for a devotee, there is no cause for lamentation in this cycle of birth and death, because his birth and death are both auspicious." [2]

A devotee's birth and death are not ordinary events, for they are connected to the Lord's service. As Srila Prabhupada elaborates:

"The devotee's birth and death are not like those of ordinary men, for a devotee is in the transcendental position, and his birth and death are both auspicious because they are connected with the service of the Lord." (SB 9.5.6, Purport) [3]

**Practical Application**

For the neophyte devotee, this verse offers a profound understanding of the significance of devotional service. By surrendering to the Lord and engaging in His service, one can transcend the material modes of nature and the bondage of karma. This realization brings a sense of freedom and peace, allowing the devotee to focus on their spiritual growth and service to the Lord.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, SB 9.5.6 reveals the extraordinary position of a devotee, who, by the Lord's mercy, is freed from the influence of material nature and the reactions of past activities. As Srila Prabhupada's teachings illuminate,
