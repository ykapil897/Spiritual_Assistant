TEXT: Prahlāda Mahārāja told his friends, "You have to begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately." All the boys were born of atheistic, materialistic families, but fortunately they had the association of Prahlāda, who was a great devotee of the Lord from his birth. Whenever he found an opportunity, when the teacher was out of the classroom, he used to say, "My dear friends, let's chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; this is the time to begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Now, as we have stated, some boy might have said, "But we are just boys. Let us play. We are not going to die immediately. Let us have some enjoyment, and later we shall begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness." People do not know that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest enjoyment. They think that the boys and girls who have joined this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are foolish. "By Prabhupāda's influence they have joined Kṛṣṇa consciousness and left everything enjoyable." But actually this is not so. They are all intelligent, educated boys and girls, coming from very respectable families; they are not fools. In our Society they are actually enjoying life; otherwise they would not have sacrificed their valuable time for this movement. Actually there is joyful life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but people do not know of it. They say, "What use is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" When one grows up entangled in the sense gratification process, it is very difficult to get out of it. Therefore, according to Vedic regulations, in student life, beginning from five years of age, boys are taught about spiritual life. That is called //brahmacarya.// A //brahmacārī// dedicates his life to attaining supreme consciousness---Kṛṣṇa consciousness or Brahman consciousness. //Brahmacarya// has many rules and regulations. For example, however rich one's father may be, the //brahmacārī// surrenders himself to be trained under the guidance of a spiritual master and works in the ashram of the spiritual master just like a menial servant. How is this possible? We are getting actual experience that very nice boys coming from very respectable families do not hesitate to do any kind of work here. They are washing dishes, cleansing floors---everything. One student's mother was astonished at her boy when he visited home. Before, he would not even go to the store, and now he is engaged twenty-four hours a day. Unless one feels pleasure, how is it possible

TEXT: childhood, begin now, in whatever position you are." That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. He never said, "Because you did not begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness from your childhood, you cannot make progress." No. He is very kind. He has given us this nice process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Whether you are young or old---no matter what you are---just begin. You do not know when your life will be finished. If you chant sincerely, even for a moment, it will have great effect. It will save you from the greatest danger---becoming an animal in your next life. Although only five years old, Prahlāda Mahārāja speaks just like a very experienced and educated man because he received knowledge from his spiritual master, Nārada Muni. That is disclosed in the next chapter of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [7.7]. Wisdom does not depend on age, but on knowledge received from a superior source. One cannot become a wise man simply by advancement of age. No. That is not possible. Knowledge has to be received from a superior source; then one can become wise. It doesn't matter whether one is a five-year-old boy or a fifty-year-old man. As it is said, "By wisdom one becomes an old man, even without advanced age." So although Prahlāda was only five years old, by advancement in knowledge he was imparting perfect instructions to his classmates. Some may find these instructions unpalatable. Suppose a man is already married and Prahlāda says, "Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness." He will think, "Oh, how can I leave my wife? We talk so nicely together, sit together and enjoy. How can I leave?" Family attraction is very strong. I am an old man---seventy-two years old. I have been away from my family during the last fourteen years. Yet sometimes I also think of my wife and children. This is quite natural. But that does not mean I have to go back. This is knowledge. When the mind wanders to thoughts of sense gratification, one should at once understand, "This is illusion." According to the Vedic system, one has to forcibly give up family life at the age of fifty. One must go. There is no alternative. The first twenty-five years are for student life. From age five to

TEXT: nature is sure to commit mistakes. Further, the conditioned soul must become illusioned. This happens when he continually mistakes one thing for something else. For example, we accept the body as the self. Since I am not this body, my acceptance of the body as my self is an illusion. The whole world is going on under the illusion that "I am this body." Therefore there is no peace. I am thinking that I am Indian, you are thinking that you are American, and a Chinese man is thinking that he is Chinese. What is this "Chinese," "American," and "Indian"? It is an illusion based on the body. That's all. The propensity to cheat is the fourth defect of conditioned life. I may be a fool, but I will boast that I am very learned. Everyone who is illusioned and commits mistakes is a fool, but still such fools pose themselves as being sources of infallible knowledge. So all conditioned souls have imperfect senses, they are subject to commit mistakes and become illusioned, and they are influenced by the propensity to cheat. How can one expect real knowledge from such conditioned souls? There is no possibility of receiving actual knowledge from them. Whether a person is a scientist, a philosopher, or whatever, because he is conditioned he cannot give complete information, no matter how educated he may be. That is a fact. One may now ask, How can we get complete information? The process is to receive knowledge via the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples beginning with Kṛṣṇa. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// Lord Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, "This knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā// was first spoken by Me to the sun-god, and the sun-god spoke it to his son, Manu. In turn, Manu spoke this knowledge to his son Ikṣvāku, and then Ikṣvāku spoke the same to his son. In this way the knowledge has come down. But unfortunately that disciplic succession is now broken. Therefore, O Arjuna, I am now imparting the same knowledge to you because you are My very dear friend and good devotee." This is the process of receiving perfect knowledge---to accept the transcendental vibration coming down from higher sources. The entire stock of Vedic knowledge is a transcendental vibration to help us understand the Supreme Lord. So, Prahlāda Mahārāja says

🕉 Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada 🕉

As we delve into the Transcendental Teachings of Prahlada Maharaja (TTP), we're reminded of the profound wisdom that Srila Prabhupada shares with us. Let's explore the essential points from this book, which will inspire us to deepen our Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

✨ Begin Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Immediately ✨

Prahlāda Mahārāja, a five-year-old devotee, taught his friends to start their spiritual journey without delay. Srila Prabhupada emphasizes this point, saying, *"You have to begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/3.txt/) This message is crucial, as it encourages us to prioritize our spiritual growth, regardless of our age or circumstances.

✨ Kṛṣṇa Consciousness: The Highest Enjoyment ✨

Many people misunderstand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, thinking that its followers are foolish. However, Srila Prabhupada reveals the truth, saying, *"They are all intelligent, educated boys and girls, coming from very respectable families; they are not fools."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/3.txt/) In reality, devotees have discovered a joyful life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is the highest form of enjoyment.

✨ Wisdom Beyond Age ✨

Prahlāda Mahārāja's story teaches us that wisdom is not limited by age. Srila Prabhupada explains, *"Wisdom does not depend on age, but on knowledge received from a superior source."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/3.txt/) This means that anyone can become wise by receiving knowledge from a genuine spiritual authority.

✨ The Importance of Disciplic Succession ✨

To receive complete information, we must follow the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples, beginning with Kṛṣṇa. Srila Prabhupada emphasizes, *"The process is to receive knowledge via the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples beginning with Kṛṣṇa."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/5.txt/) This ensures that we receive authentic knowledge, untainted by personal interpretations or biases.

✨ Reflection and Application ✨

As we reflect on these essential points from the Transcendental Teachings of Prahlada Maharaja, let's ask ourselves: Am I prioritizing my spiritual growth, or am I delaying it? Am I seeking knowledge from a superior source, or am I relying on my own limited understanding? By embracing these teachings, we can deepen our Kṛṣṇa consciousness and experience the highest form of enjoyment.

May Srila Prabhupada's wisdom guide us on our spiritual journey, and may we remain committed to the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
