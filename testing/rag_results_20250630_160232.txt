TEXT: that everyone become Kṛṣṇa conscious by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This is practical, simple, and sublime. Four hundred and eighty years ago this formula was introduced in India by Lord Śrī Caitanya, and now it is available in your country. Take to this simple process of chanting as above mentioned, realize your factual position by reading the //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// and reestablish your lost relationship with Kṛṣṇa, God. Peace and prosperity will be the immediate worldwide result. ===== Spiritual Communism ===== In 1971, during his historic visit to the Soviet Union, Śrīla Prabhupāda was introduced to Professor Grigoriy Kotovsky, head of the India Department at the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences and chairman of the Indian studies department at the University of Moscow. As they sat informally in Dr. Kotovsky's office, the spiritual leader and the communist scholar vigorously discussed topics of mutual concern, and Śrīla Prabhupāda proposed a radical reformation within modern communism. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** The other day I was reading the paper, //Moscow News.// There was a Communist congress, and the President declared, "We are ready to take others' experience to improve." So I think the Vedic concept of socialism or communism will much improve the idea of communism. For example, in a socialistic state the idea is that no one should starve; everyone must have his food. Similarly, in the Vedic concept of //gṛhastha// [householder] life it is recommended that a householder see that even a lizard or a snake living in his house should not starve. Even these lower creatures should be given food, and certainly all humans should. It is recommended that the //gṛhastha,// before taking his lunch, stand on the road and declare, "If anyone is still hungry, please come! Food is ready!" If there is no response, then the proprietor of the household takes his lunch. Modern society takes the people as a whole as the proprietor of a certain state, but the Vedic conception is //īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1]//---everything is owned by //īśa,// the supreme controller. //Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ//---you may enjoy what is allotted to you by Him. //Mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam:// but do not encroach upon others' property. This is the //Īśopaniṣad-Veda.// The same idea is explained in the

TEXT: respect him because he is a government man. But that does not mean he //is// the government. //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair/ uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ:// "The spiritual master is to be honored as much as the Supreme Lord because he is the most confidential servitor of the Lord. This is acknowledged in all revealed scriptures and followed by all authorities." **Ms. Nixon:** I also wonder about the many beautiful material things that the devotees bring you. For instance, you left the airport in a beautiful, fancy car. I wonder about this because... **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** That teaches the disciples how to regard the spiritual master as good as God. If you respect the government representative as much as you respect the government, then you must treat him opulently. If you respect the spiritual master as much as God, then you must offer him the same facilities you would offer to God. God travels in a golden car. If the disciples offer the spiritual master an ordinary motorcar, it would not be sufficient, because the spiritual master has to be treated like God. If God comes to your home, will you bring him an ordinary motorcar---or will you arrange for a golden car? **Ms. Nixon:** One of the most difficult aspects of Kṛṣṇa consciousness for an outsider to accept is the Deity in the temple---how it represents Kṛṣṇa. Could you talk a little bit about that? **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Yes. At the present moment, because you have not been trained to see Kṛṣṇa, He kindly appears before you so you can see Him. You can see wood and stone, but you cannot see what is spiritual. Suppose your father is in the hospital, and he dies. You are crying by his bedside, "Now my father is gone!" But why do you say he is gone? What is that thing which is gone? **Ms. Nixon:** Well, his spirit is gone. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** And have you seen that spirit? **Ms. Nixon:** No. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** So you cannot see spirit, and God is the Supreme Spirit. Actually, He is everything---spirit and matter---but you cannot see Him in His spiritual identity. Therefore, to show kindness toward you, He appears out of His unbounded mercy in the form of a wooden or stone Deity so that you can see Him. **Ms. Nixon:** Thank

TEXT: we do not object to that. **Prof. Kotovsky:** Yes, I don't think you can object, but at the same time, something has to be done in India. One may call it Westernization, but this introduction to an industrial technological revolution is needed in all fields of Indian life---agriculture, industry, etc. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Arjuna, before understanding the //Bhagavad-gītā,// was a fighter, and after understanding the //Bhagavad-gītā// he remained a fighter. So we don't want to change the position. For example, you are a respectable professor, a teacher. We don't say that you must change your position. We have come to convince you about our philosophy. That is all. Arjuna was refusing to fight. "Kṛṣṇa, I don't want to kill my relatives. I do not want this kingdom." But he was taught the //Bhagavad-gītā,// and at the end when Kṛṣṇa inquired, "What is your decision now?" he said, //kariṣye vacanaṁ tava//---"Yes, I shall act as You say." [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]. That means that his consciousness changed. He was a fighter, and he remained a fighter, but he changed his consciousness. We want that. We don't want to disturb the present condition of society. We are not against technology. No, but we try to make one understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is our program. **Prof. Kotovsky:** Of course, at the same time the final goal of any consciousness is to change the society---to make it a better society. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** That is automatic. **Prof. Kotovsky:** I am not really so happy that the ultimate goal is not to disturb society, because in modern society there are many things to be changed through consciousness. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** That preliminary change is to follow rules and regulations of austerity. For example, don't take intoxicants. **Prof. Kotovsky:** No indulging in intoxicants---simplicity, etc. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** So if one takes to this process... **Prof. Kotovsky:** Then the others will come automatically. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** One's whole life will change, because these four things---illicit sex life, intoxicants, meat-eating and gambling---are very great impediments to social improvement. **Prof. Kotovsky:** That will automatically make life simpler, because a person who does not indulge in illicit sex, intoxicants, and such other things has to lead a comparatively simple life. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** The other day I was speaking in Bombay with a respectable gentleman. I was telling him that Kṛṣṇa
