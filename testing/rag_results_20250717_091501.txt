5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Honoring Srila Prabhupada's Guidance

As we embark on our spiritual journey, it's essential to understand the role of the caitya guru, a concept that Srila Prabhupada beautifully explains in his teachings.

‚ú® The Caitya Guru: Our Internal Guide

Srila Prabhupada teaches us that the caitya guru is none other than the Supersoul within our heart. As he says, *"The caitya-guru, the spiritual master, is the Supersoul, the guide from within."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/pop/6.txt) This internal guide is always present, offering us wisdom and direction on our path to self-realization.

‚ú® Awakening Our Love for Krsna

The caitya guru plays a crucial role in awakening our dormant love for Krsna. Srila Prabhupada explains, *"The caitya-guru helps to awaken our dormant love for Krsna, and the diksa-guru, the spiritual master who initiates, helps to increase that love."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/pop/6.txt) This internal awakening is the foundation of our spiritual growth, and the caitya guru is the catalyst that sets it in motion.

‚ú® Internal vs. External Guidance

To further clarify the role of the caitya guru, Srila Prabhupada distinguishes between internal and external guidance. He says, *"The caitya-guru is the internal spiritual guide, and the diksa-guru is the external guide."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/pop/6.txt) This means that while our external guru provides us with guidance and support, the caitya guru is the constant, internal presence that guides us from within.

‚ú® Reflection and Application

As we reflect on the role of the caitya guru, let us remember that this internal guide is always present, waiting to be heard. By tuning in to our heart and cultivating a deeper connection with the Supersoul, we can receive the guidance we need to progress on our spiritual journey. Let us take a moment to quiet our minds and listen to the gentle whispers of our caitya guru, allowing ourselves to be guided towards a deeper love for Krsna.
