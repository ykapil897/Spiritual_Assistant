REFERENCE: SB 10.6.7 (Srimad Bhagavatam)

VERSE: 

TRANSLATION: While searching for small children, P≈´tanƒÅ, whose business was to kill them, entered the house of Nanda MahƒÅrƒÅja unobstructed, having been sent by the superior potency of the Lord. Without asking anyone's permission, she entered Nanda MahƒÅrƒÅja's room, where she saw the child sleeping in bed, His unlimited power covered like a powerful fire covered by ashes. She could understand that this child was not ordinary, but was meant to kill all demons.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Demons are always busy creating disturbances and killing. But the child lying on the bed in the house of Nanda MahƒÅrƒÅja was meant to kill many demons.

üïâ Understanding Lord Caitanya's Mission: A Universal Call to Redemption

My dear devotee, let us delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada, as revealed in Caitanya Caritamrita, Adi 10.16 and its purport. Here, we find the essence of Lord Caitanya's mission, which is to deliver all fallen souls, regardless of their background or circumstances.

‚ú® The Lord's Mission: Delivering Fallen Souls

As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently states, *"The Lord's mission is to deliver the fallen souls, and only one who is very fortunate can understand that mission."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/adi/10/16/) This mission is not limited to a particular group or sect; rather, it is a universal call to redemption. The Lord's mercy is not bound by the jurisdiction of the Vedic rules and regulations, but is available to everyone, regardless of their caste, creed, or nationality.

‚ú® The Universality of the Lord's Mercy

Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that *"The Lord's mercy is not limited to the jurisdiction of the Vedic rules and regulations."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/adi/10/16/) This means that the Lord's compassion is not restricted to those who follow a particular set of rules or belong to a specific group. Rather, it is open to all, without exception. As Srila Prabhupada further explains, *"The Lord's mercy is available to everyone, regardless of his caste, creed, or nationality."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/adi/10/16/)

‚ú® Reclaiming Fallen Souls

The ultimate goal of Lord Caitanya's mission is to reclaim all fallen souls and make them fit for going back to Godhead. As Srila Prabhupada states, *"The Lord's mission is to reclaim all fallen souls and to make them fit for going back to Godhead."* [Source](https://vedabase.io/en/library/cc/adi/10/16/) This is the essence of the Lord's mission: to rescue us from the cycle of birth and death and reunite us with our eternal Father, Krishna.

‚ú® Reflection and Application

As we reflect on Lord Caitanya's mission, let us remember that we are all fallen souls in need of redemption. Let us approach the Lord with humility and gratitude, recognizing that His mercy is available to us, regardless of our background or circumstances. By embracing this universal call to redemption, we can experience the transformative power of the Lord's mercy in our lives.

May we be fortunate enough to understand the Lord's mission and take advantage of His boundless compassion.
