REFERENCE: Bg. 18.76 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: rājan saṁsmṛtya saṁsmṛtyasaṁvādam imam adbhutamkeśavārjunayoḥ puṇyaṁhṛṣyāmi ca muhur muhuḥ

TRANSLATION: O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The understanding of Bhagavad-gītā is so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa becomes righteous and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears the Gītā from the right source, directly from Kṛṣṇa, attains full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The result of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment.

REFERENCE: Bg. 7.3 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣukaścid yatati siddhayeyatatām api siddhānāṁkaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ

TRANSLATION: Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: There are various grades of men, and out of many thousands, one may be sufficiently interested in transcendental realization to try to know what is the self, what is the body, and what is the Absolute Truth. Generally mankind is simply engaged in the animal propensities, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating, and hardly anyone is interested in transcendental knowledge. The first six chapters of the Gītā are meant for those who are interested in transcendental knowledge, in understanding the self, the Superself and the process of realization by jñāna-yoga, dhyāna-yoga and discrimination of the self from matter. However, Kṛṣṇa can be known only by persons who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Other transcendentalists may achieve impersonal Brahman realization, for this is easier than understanding Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, but at the same time He is beyond the knowledge of Brahman and Paramātmā. The yogīs and jñānīs are confused in their attempts to understand Kṛṣṇa. Although the greatest of the impersonalists, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, has admitted in his Gītā commentary that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, his followers do not accept Kṛṣṇa as such, for it is very difficult to know Kṛṣṇa, even though one has transcendental realization of impersonal Brahman.

Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ/ anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam. It is very difficult for the nondevotees to know Him. Although nondevotees declare that the path of bhakti, or devotional service, is very easy, they cannot practice it. If the path of bhakti is so easy, as the nondevotee class of men proclaim, then why do they take up the difficult path? Actually the path of bhakti is not easy. The so-called path of bhakti practiced by unauthorized persons without knowledge of bhakti may be easy, but when it is practiced factually according to the rules and regulations, the speculative scholars and philosophers fall away from the path. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī writes in his Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu (1.2.101):

śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vināaikāntikī harer bhaktirutpātāyaiva kalpate

“Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upaniṣads, Purāṇas and Nārada Pañcarātra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.”

“Devotional service of the Lord that ignores the authorized Vedic literatures like the Upaniṣads, Purāṇas and Nārada Pañcarātra is simply an unnecessary disturbance in society.”

It is not possible for the Brahman-realized impersonalist or the Paramātmā-realized yogī to understand Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the son of mother Yaśodā or the charioteer of Arjuna. Even the great demigods are sometimes confused about Kṛṣṇa (muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ). Māṁ tu veda na kaścana: “No one knows Me as I am,” the Lord says. And if one does know Him, then sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ: “Such a great soul is very rare.” Therefore unless one practices devotional service to the Lord, one cannot know Kṛṣṇa as He is (tattvataḥ), even though one is a great scholar or philosopher. Only the pure devotees can know something of the inconceivable transcendental qualities in Kṛṣṇa – His being the cause of all causes, His omnipotence and opulence, and His wealth, fame, strength, beauty, knowledge and renunciation – because Kṛṣṇa is benevolently inclined to His devotees. He is the last word in Brahman realization, and the devotees alone can realize Him as He is. Therefore it is said:

REFERENCE: Bg. 2.10 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: tam uvāca hṛṣīkeśaḥprahasann iva bhāratasenayor ubhayor madhyeviṣīdantam idaṁ vacaḥ

TRANSLATION: O descendant of Bharata, at that time Kṛṣṇa, smiling, in the midst of both the armies, spoke the following words to the grief-stricken Arjuna.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The talk was going on between intimate friends, namely the Hṛṣīkeśa and the Guḍākeśa. As friends, both of them were on the same level, but one of them voluntarily became a student of the other. Kṛṣṇa was smiling because a friend had chosen to become a disciple. As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord agrees to be a friend, a son or a lover for a devotee who wants Him in such a role. But when He was accepted as the master, He at once assumed the role and talked with the disciple like the master – with gravity, as it is required. It appears that the talk between the master and the disciple was openly exchanged in the presence of both armies so that all were benefited. So the talks of Bhagavad-gītā are not for any particular person, society, or community, but they are for all, and friends or enemies are equally entitled to hear them.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🕉 Understanding Krsna: The Supreme Personality of Godhead

My dear devotee, let us delve into the wonderful world of Krsna consciousness, where we can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krsna. As Srila Prabhupada so beautifully puts it, **"Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the primeval Lord Govinda."** [Bg. 7.3, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/7/3.txt)

✨ Knowing Krsna

But how can we know Krsna? Srila Prabhupada explains that **"Krsna can be known only by persons who are in Krsna consciousness."** [Bg. 7.3, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/7/3.txt) This means that we need to cultivate a consciousness that is connected with Krsna, a consciousness that is filled with love and devotion for Him.

✨ Krsna Reveals Himself

The good news is that Krsna is eager to reveal Himself to us. As Srila Prabhupada says, **"No one can understand Krsna as He is by the blunt material senses. But He reveals Himself to the devotees, being pleased with them for their transcendental loving service unto Him."** [Bg. 7.3, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/7/3.txt) This means that when we surrender to Krsna and offer our love and service to Him, He will reveal His true nature to us.

✨ Krsna's Relationships

What's more, Krsna is willing to take on various roles in our lives, depending on our desire. As Srila Prabhupada explains, **"As Lord of all, He is always in the superior position as the master of everyone, and yet the Lord agrees to be a friend, a son or a lover for a devotee who wants Him in such a role."** [Bg. 2.10, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/2/10.txt) This means that we can have a personal relationship with Krsna, one that is tailored to our individual desires and needs.

✨ Practical Application

So, my dear devotee, let us take these words of Srila Prabhupada to heart. Let us cultivate a Krsna conscious mindset, one that is filled with love and devotion for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Let us surrender to Krsna and offer our service to Him, and He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never thought possible. And let us not be afraid to ask Krsna to take on a role in our lives, whether it be as a friend
