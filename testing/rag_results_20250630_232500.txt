TEXT: than first class. Furthermore, the temple should always be as clean as glass. Everyone remarks that the temples of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are very clean, and they //must// be very clean. The more one cleanses the temple, the more one's heart becomes cleansed. This is the process of devotional service. The more we dress Kṛṣṇa, the more satisfied we become. At the present moment we are accustomed to seeing and appreciating our own clothing. I think, "What costly clothing I have," and in this way I become satisfied. But when we dress Kṛṣṇa we shall feel spiritual satisfaction. > yuktasya bhaktāṁś ca niyuñjato 'pi > vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam It is the duty of the spiritual master to engage his disciples always in worshiping the Deity in this way, and it is to such a //guru,// or spiritual master, that we offer our obeisances.

To preach, to chant, so that people may get the opportunity to hear this philosophy and take it seriously (//gṛṇanti//). The word //abhīkṣṇaśaḥ// indicates that these engagements should go on continuously, twenty-four hours a day without stopping. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore recommends, //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ:// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]] one should engage in chanting twenty-four hours a day. That is the business of Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees. One may perform all the methods of devotional service or may accept only one. Simply hearing is enough. Parīkṣit Mahārāja did not do anything else but sit down before Śukadeva Gosvāmī and hear for the last seven days of his life.
