### 📖 The Power of Chanting and Preaching

**Prabhupāda:** If you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, the **mahā-mantra**, but you cannot read books, there is no harm. There is no loss. That chanting is sufficient. But if you read, then you will be able to defend yourself from the opposing parties. That will help you in your preaching work. Because in the preaching work, you have to answer so many questions, you have to meet so many opposing elements, so if you are strong in your position by reading books, Vedic literature, then you become very, very favorite to Kṛṣṇa.

**SHLOKA:**

**na ca tasmāt manuṣyeṣu kaścit me priya-kṛttamaḥ**
— *Bg. 18.69*

**ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati**
— *Bg. 18.68*

**sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja**
— *Bg. 18.66*

**Prabhupāda:** Kṛṣṇa says, "Anyone who preaches this confidential knowledge, if he is ably fit to preach this message to the world, then immediately he becomes very, very much recognized by the Supreme Lord." So I am especially requesting those who are Indians and those who have now learned **Bhagavad-gītā**, they should preach this message all over the world. There is good potency. That already we have tested. But don't make adulteration. Then it will be spoiled. You speak **Bhagavad-gītā** as it is, and it will be effective. Why it will not be effective? Because the Lord's word and the Lord Himself, absolute. There is no difference.

**SHLOKA:**

**nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaḥ**
**caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ**
**pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto**
**abhinnatvāt nāma-nāminoḥ**
— *Cc. Madhya 17.133*

**Prabhupāda:** The Lord's name and the Lord, they are not different—absolute. That is Lord's potency, **acintya-śakti**. He can present Himself by His name, by His fame, by His form, by His qualities, by His paraphernalia. Anything in connection with Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa. Anything. That is absolute. Kṛṣṇa is never different from His name. Kṛṣṇa is never different from His form. We are worshiping the form of the Lord. That is Lord Himself. Don't think it is different from Lord. No. We are not wasting time by worshiping some statue. No. It is therefore forbidden in the **śāstra**, **arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīḥ guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhir** [Padma Purāṇa]. These are forbidden. So we are, of course, opening so many branches all over the world, and I am very pleased to see this branch. There is wonderful prospective. Utilize it properly, and stick to the principle that **āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa** [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]].

**Prabhupāda:** The **ājñā**, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and **ājñā**, our Kṛṣṇa, not different. Because Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and when He appeared as Kṛṣṇa, people misunderstood Him; therefore He has come as a devotee to teach us how to love Kṛṣṇa. So therefore, if we go through Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, chanting, **śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda**, and then we chant **Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare**, so rest assured the full perfection is awaiting you.

*Key Insight: Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and preaching the message of Kṛṣṇa brings spiritual perfection.*

### 📖 The Importance of Spiritual Knowledge

**Prabhupāda:** Thank you very much.

**Devotees:** **Jaya** Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:** **bhave 'smin kliśyamānānām avidyā-kāma-karmabhiḥ...**
