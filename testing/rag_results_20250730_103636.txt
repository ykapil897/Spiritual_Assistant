REFERENCE: Bg. 18.72 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: kaccid etac chrutaṁ pārthatvayaikāgreṇa cetasākaccid ajñāna-sammohaḥpraṇaṣṭas te dhanañ-jaya

TRANSLATION: O son of Pṛthā, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gītā in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-gītā if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gītā from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gītā is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.

REFERENCE: Bg. 18.68 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁmad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyatibhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvāmām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ

TRANSLATION: For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gītā be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will understand neither Kṛṣṇa nor Bhagavad-gītā. Those who do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and Bhagavad-gītā as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad-gītā whimsically and become offenders. Bhagavad-gītā should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad-gītā as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.

REFERENCE: Bg. 15.20 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: iti guhya-tamaṁ śāstramidam uktaṁ mayānaghaetad buddhvā buddhimān syātkṛta-kṛtyaś ca bhārata

TRANSLATION: This is the most confidential part of the Vedic scriptures, O sinless one, and it is disclosed now by Me. Whoever understands this will become wise, and his endeavors will know perfection.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge. In other words, by understanding this philosophy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engaging in His transcendental service, everyone can become freed from all contaminations of the modes of material nature. Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist. Devotional service to the Lord and the Lord Himself are one and the same because they are spiritual; devotional service takes place within the internal energy of the Supreme Lord. The Lord is said to be the sun, and ignorance is called darkness. Where the sun is present, there is no question of darkness. Therefore, whenever devotional service is present under the proper guidance of a bona fide spiritual master, there is no question of ignorance.

Everyone must take to this consciousness of Kṛṣṇa and engage in devotional service to become intelligent and purified. Unless one comes to this position of understanding Kṛṣṇa and engages in devotional service, however intelligent he may be in the estimation of some common man, he is not perfectly intelligent.

The word anagha, by which Arjuna is addressed, is significant. Anagha, “O sinless one,” means that unless one is free from all sinful reactions it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. One has to become free from all contamination, all sinful activities; then he can understand. But devotional service is so pure and potent that once one is engaged in devotional service he automatically comes to the stage of sinlessness.

While one is performing devotional service in the association of pure devotees in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there are certain things which require to be vanquished altogether. The most important thing one has to surmount is weakness of the heart. The first falldown is caused by the desire to lord it over material nature. Thus one gives up the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord. The second weakness of the heart is that as one increases the propensity to lord it over material nature, he becomes attached to matter and the possession of matter. The problems of material existence are due to these weaknesses of the heart. In this chapter the first five verses describe the process of freeing oneself from these weaknesses of heart, and the rest of the chapter, from the sixth verse through the end, discusses puruṣottama-yoga.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🕉 The Power of Preaching Bhagavad Gita

My dear devotee, let us begin by acknowledging the immense contribution of Srila Prabhupada in spreading the teachings of Bhagavad Gita. His guidance on preaching the Gita's message is invaluable, and today, we'll explore why preaching Bhagavad Gita is considered the highest service.

✨ The Highest Service

Srila Prabhupada explains in Bhagavad Gita 18.68, "For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/68.txt) This verse highlights the importance of sharing the message of Bhagavad Gita with others. By doing so, we not only benefit ourselves but also help others on their spiritual journey.

✨ Exclusivity of Bhagavad Gita Discussion

However, Srila Prabhupada also advises that Bhagavad Gita should be discussed amongst devotees only. In the same purport, he writes, "Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gītā be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will understand neither Kṛṣṇa nor Bhagavad-gītā." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/68.txt) This is because the Gita's message is subtle and requires a certain level of spiritual understanding.

✨ Spiritual Intelligence and Purification

So, what happens when we understand Bhagavad Gita? Srila Prabhupada explains in Bhagavad Gita 15.20, "The Lord clearly explains here that this is the substance of all revealed scriptures. And one should understand this as it is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus one will become intelligent and perfect in transcendental knowledge." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/15/20.txt) By understanding the Gita, we develop spiritual intelligence and become purified.

✨ Devotional Service and Spiritual Understanding

Furthermore, Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. In the same purport, he writes, "Devotional service is a process of spiritual understanding. Wherever devotional service exists, the material contamination cannot coexist." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/15/20.txt) This means that as we engage in devotional service, we naturally develop a deeper understanding of the spiritual realm.

✨ Reflection

In conclusion, preaching Bhagavad Gita is not only a service to others but also a means of purifying ourselves. By sharing the Gita's message, we develop spiritual intelligence, and our devotional service becomes more profound. Let us
