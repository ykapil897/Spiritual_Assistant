REFERENCE: Bg. 18.72 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: kaccid etac chrutaṁ pārthatvayaikāgreṇa cetasākaccid ajñāna-sammohaḥpraṇaṣṭas te dhanañ-jaya

TRANSLATION: O son of Pṛthā, O conqueror of wealth, have you heard this with an attentive mind? And are your ignorance and illusions now dispelled?

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The Lord was acting as the spiritual master of Arjuna. Therefore it was His duty to inquire from Arjuna whether he understood the whole Bhagavad-gītā in its proper perspective. If not, the Lord was ready to re-explain any point, or the whole Bhagavad-gītā if so required. Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gītā from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled. Bhagavad-gītā is not an ordinary book written by a poet or fiction writer; it is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Any person fortunate enough to hear these teachings from Kṛṣṇa or from His bona fide spiritual representative is sure to become a liberated person and get out of the darkness of ignorance.

REFERENCE: Bg. 18.68 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁmad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyatibhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvāmām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ

TRANSLATION: For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Generally it is advised that Bhagavad-gītā be discussed amongst the devotees only, for those who are not devotees will understand neither Kṛṣṇa nor Bhagavad-gītā. Those who do not accept Kṛṣṇa as He is and Bhagavad-gītā as it is should not try to explain Bhagavad-gītā whimsically and become offenders. Bhagavad-gītā should be explained to persons who are ready to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is a subject matter for the devotees only and not for philosophical speculators. Anyone, however, who tries sincerely to present Bhagavad-gītā as it is will advance in devotional activities and reach the pure devotional state of life. As a result of such pure devotion, he is sure to go back home, back to Godhead.

REFERENCE: Bg. 18.76 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: rājan saṁsmṛtya saṁsmṛtyasaṁvādam imam adbhutamkeśavārjunayoḥ puṇyaṁhṛṣyāmi ca muhur muhuḥ

TRANSLATION: O King, as I repeatedly recall this wondrous and holy dialogue between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, I take pleasure, being thrilled at every moment.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The understanding of Bhagavad-gītā is so transcendental that anyone who becomes conversant with the topics of Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa becomes righteous and he cannot forget such talks. This is the transcendental position of spiritual life. In other words, one who hears the Gītā from the right source, directly from Kṛṣṇa, attains full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The result of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is that one becomes increasingly enlightened, and he enjoys life with a thrill, not only for some time, but at every moment.

Srila Prabhupada emphasizes that preaching the Bhagavad Gita is a guaranteed way to attain pure devotional service. In the Bhagavad Gita, 18.68, Purport, he writes, *"For one who explains this supreme secret to the devotees, pure devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/bg/18/68.txt)

Hearing the Bhagavad Gita from a bona fide spiritual master dispels ignorance and leads to liberation. As Srila Prabhupada explains in Bhagavad Gita, 18.72, Purport, *"Actually, anyone who hears Bhagavad-gītā from a bona fide spiritual master like Kṛṣṇa or His representative will find that all his ignorance is dispelled.
