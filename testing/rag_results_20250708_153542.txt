REFERENCE: Bg. 4.5 (Bhagavad Gita)

VERSE: śrī-bhagavān uvācabahūni me vyatītānijanmāni tava cārjunatāny ahaṁ veda sarvāṇina tvaṁ vettha paran-tapa

TRANSLATION: The Personality of Godhead said: Many, many births both you and I have passed. I can remember all of them, but you cannot, O subduer of the enemy!

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: In the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:

In the Brahma-saṁhitā (5.33) we have information of many, many incarnations of the Lord. It is stated there:

advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpamādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ cavedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktaugovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning. Although expanded into unlimited forms, He is still the same original, the oldest, and the person always appearing as a fresh youth. Such eternal, blissful, all-knowing forms of the Lord are usually not understood by even the best Vedic scholars, but they are always manifest to pure, unalloyed devotees.”

It is also stated in Brahma-saṁhitā (5.39):

It is also stated in Brahma-saṁhitā (5.39):

rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhannānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintukṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yogovindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also.”

“I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also.”

In the Vedas also it is said that the Lord, although one without a second, manifests Himself in innumerable forms. He is like the vaidūrya stone, which changes color yet still remains one. All those multiforms are understood by the pure, unalloyed devotees, but not by a simple study of the Vedas (vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau). Devotees like Arjuna are constant companions of the Lord, and whenever the Lord incarnates, the associate devotees also incarnate in order to serve the Lord in different capacities. Arjuna is one of these devotees, and in this verse it is understood that some millions of years ago when Lord Kṛṣṇa spoke the Bhagavad-gītā to the sun-god Vivasvān, Arjuna, in a different capacity, was also present. But the difference between the Lord and Arjuna is that the Lord remembered the incident whereas Arjuna could not remember. That is the difference between the part-and-parcel living entity and the Supreme Lord. Although Arjuna is addressed herein as the mighty hero who could subdue the enemies, he is unable to recall what had happened in his various past births. Therefore, a living entity, however great he may be in the material estimation, can never equal the Supreme Lord. Anyone who is a constant companion of the Lord is certainly a liberated person, but he cannot be equal to the Lord. The Lord is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact. Therefore, the Lord and the living entity can never be equal in all respects, even if the living entity is as liberated as Arjuna. Although Arjuna is a devotee of the Lord, he sometimes forgets the nature of the Lord, but by the divine grace a devotee can at once understand the infallible condition of the Lord, whereas a nondevotee or a demon cannot understand this transcendental nature. Consequently these descriptions in the Gītā cannot be understood by demonic brains. Kṛṣṇa remembered acts which were performed by Him millions of years before, but Arjuna could not, despite the fact that both Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are eternal in nature. We may also note herein that a living entity forgets everything due to his change of body, but the Lord remembers because He does not change His sac-cid-ānanda body. He is advaita, which means there is no distinction between His body and Himself. Everything in relation to Him is spirit – whereas the conditioned soul is different from his material body. And because the Lord’s body and self are identical, His position is always different from that of the ordinary living entity, even when He descends to the material platform. The demons cannot adjust themselves to this transcendental nature of the Lord, which the Lord Himself explains in the following verse.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Session Title:** Understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead: The Unparalleled Position of Krishna

**Gita Reference:** Bg. 4.5, Brahma-saṁhitā (5.33, 5.39)

**Opening Hook:** "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, is the ultimate authority, the source of all creation, and the essence of all existence. But have you ever wondered why He is called the Supreme Personality of Godhead?" Let's dive into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada to uncover the significance of this title.

**Core Teaching:** In the Brahma-saṁhitā, Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna is called the Supreme Personality of Godhead because He is the original person, absolute, infallible, and without beginning. As Srila Prabhupada quotes, "I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is the original person – absolute, infallible, without beginning." (Brahma-saṁhitā, 5.33) This statement highlights Krishna's unique position as the source of all existence, beyond the limitations of time and space.

**Frameworks or Levels:** To further understand Krishna's supremacy, let's examine His incarnations. Srila Prabhupada explains that Krishna is the original Personality of Godhead, who incarnates personally and also expands into various incarnations, such as Rāma and Nṛsiṁha. As Srila Prabhupada quotes, "I worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda [Kṛṣṇa], who is always situated in various incarnations such as Rāma, Nṛsiṁha and many subincarnations as well, but who is the original Personality of Godhead known as Kṛṣṇa, and who incarnates personally also." (Brahma-saṁhitā, 5.39) This demonstrates Krishna's unparalleled ability to manifest in various forms, while remaining the same, absolute truth.

**Practical Application:** Reflect on the significance of Krishna's infallibility (acyuta). As Srila Prabhupada explains, "The Lord is described in the Brahma-saṁhitā as infallible (acyuta), which means that He never forgets Himself, even though He is in material contact." (Bg. 4.5) This means that Krishna, unlike us, is never influenced by the material world and always remains in His original, divine state. Take a moment to contemplate how this understanding can inspire you to cultivate a deeper connection with Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Micro-practice:** Throughout the day, take a few moments to repeat the mantra "Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead" and reflect on His infallible nature. This simple practice will help you stay connected with Krishna's divine presence and inspire you to deepen your understanding of His supreme position.

**Closing Reflection:** As we conclude this session, let's remember Srila Prabhupada's words: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, is the ultimate authority, the source of all creation, and the essence of all existence." May this understanding guide us on our spiritual journey, as we strive to develop a deeper appreciation for Krishna's unparalleled position as the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
