REFERENCE: SB 4.13.5 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: My dear brāhmaṇa, how did Nārada Muni glorify the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and what pastimes were described in that meeting? I am very eager to hear of them. Kindly explain fully about that glorification of the Lord.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the record of //bhagavat-kathā,// topics about the pastimes of the Lord. What Vidura was anxious to hear from Maitreya we can also hear five thousand years later, provided we are very eager.

REFERENCE: SB 3.32.43 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Anyone who once meditates upon Me with faith and affection, who hears and chants about Me, surely goes back home, back to Godhead.


Thus end the Bhaktivedanta purports of the Third Canto, Thirty-second Chapter, of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// entitled "Entanglement in Fruitive Activities."

REFERENCE: SB 1.4.28 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: I have, under strict disciplinary vows, unpretentiously worshiped the Vedas, the spiritual master and the altar of sacrifice. I have also abided by the rulings and have shown the import of disciplic succession through the explanation of the Mahābhārata, by which even women, śūdras and others [friends of the twice-born] can see the path of religion.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: No one can understand the import of the //Vedas// without having undergone a strict disciplinary vow and disciplic succession. The //Vedas,// spiritual masters and sacrificial fire must be worshiped by the desiring candidate. All these intricacies of Vedic knowledge are systematically presented in the //Mahābhārata// for the understanding of the woman class, the laborer class and the unqualified members of //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// families. In this age, the //Mahābhārata// is more essential than the original //Vedas.//

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Session Title:** The Power of Hearing about the Lord's Pastimes

**Gita Reference:** None (since the question is related to the Srimad Bhagavatam)

**Opening Hook:**
Imagine being in the presence of a great spiritual master, hearing about the Lord's pastimes, and feeling your heart filled with faith and affection. This is exactly what Vidura experienced when he heard from Maitreya, as described in the Srimad Bhagavatam. As Srila Prabhupada says, "What Vidura was anxious to hear from Maitreya we can also hear five thousand years later, provided we are very eager." [SB 4.13.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/4/13/5.txt)

**Core Teaching:**
In the Srimad Bhagavatam, we find the importance of hearing about the Lord's pastimes emphasized repeatedly. This is not just a casual activity, but an essential part of our spiritual advancement. By hearing about the Lord's pastimes, we can develop faith and affection for Him, which is crucial for our spiritual growth. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the record of bhagavat-kathā, topics about the pastimes of the Lord." [SB 4.13.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/4/13/5.txt)

**Frameworks or Levels:**
There are different levels of hearing about the Lord's pastimes. On one level, we may hear about them intellectually, understanding the stories and events. However, on a deeper level, we can hear about them with faith and affection, allowing ourselves to be transformed by the experience. This is what Srila Prabhupada means when he says, "Anyone who once meditates upon Me with faith and affection, who hears and chants about Me, surely goes back home, back to Godhead." [SB 3.32.43, Translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/32/43.txt)

**Practical Application:**
Take a few minutes to reflect on your own experience of hearing about the Lord's pastimes. Have you ever felt a sense of faith and affection arising within you as you heard about the Lord's activities? How can you cultivate this experience in your daily life?

**Micro-practice:**
Set aside some time each day to hear about the Lord's pastimes, either by reading the Srimad Bhagavatam or listening to a devotee's narration. As you hear, try to focus on the Lord's activities with faith and affection, allowing yourself to be transformed by the experience.

**Closing Reflection:**
As we conclude this session, let us remember the importance of hearing about the Lord's pastimes in our spiritual journey. As Srila Prabhupada says, "What Vidura was anxious to hear from Maitreya we can also hear five thousand years later, provided we are very eager." [SB 4.13.5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/4/13/5.txt) Let us cultivate this eagerness in our own lives, and allow the Lord's pastimes to transform us on our path to self-realization.

**Key Quotes:**

**Summary:**
