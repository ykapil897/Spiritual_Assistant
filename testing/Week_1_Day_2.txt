### 📖 Understanding Bhagavad-gītā

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm. So, here it is explained what is **Bhagavad-gītā**. **Gītaṁ bhagavatā**. **Bhagavatā** means "by the Supreme Personality of Godhead," and **gītaṁ** means "spoken." They say "sung by." You can say. But **gītaṁ** means "spoken by." Therefore it is called **Bhagavad-gītā**, "the instruction given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally." Therefore it is called **Bhagavad-gītā**.

Now Arjuna said that this science was spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we read **Bhagavad-gītā**, then we must follow the version of Arjuna, because Arjuna directly heard **Bhagavad-gītā** from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And he says that this science, **gītaṁ bhagavatā**. So why there should be interpretation? Because the person who heard directly from Bhagavān, the Supreme Per..., he says that this is spoken by the **Bhagavad-gī...**, erm, Supreme Personality of Godhead. So one who is hearing directly, he's saying something, but you are saying something. You have no right. This is called **paramparā** system.

The person who heard **Bhagavad-gītā** directly from Kṛṣṇa, whatever he says, that is to be accepted. You cannot interpret. This is the **paramparā** system. So if you want to understand **Bhagavad-gītā**, then we must understand in the same way as the person who directly heard from him. This is called **paramparā** system.

Suppose I have heard something from my spiritual master, so I speak to you the same thing. So this is **paramparā** system. You cannot imagine what my spiritual master said. Or even if you read some books, you cannot understand unless you understand it from me. This is called **paramparā** system. You cannot jump over to the superior **guru**, I mean to say, neglecting the next **ācārya**.

Just like our this Gau..., Caitanya Mahāprabhu's cult; we cannot understand Caitanya Mahāprabhu directly. This is not possible. We have to understand through the Gosvāmīs. Therefore you'll find in the **Caitanya-caritāmṛta**, in..., at the end of every chapter, the writer says, **rūpa-raghunātha-pade...**


**Yaśomatīnandana:** **Caitanya-caritāmṛta kahe.**


**Prabhupāda:** **Kṛṣṇa-dāsa.**

SHLOKA:

**rūpa-raghunātha-pade yāra āśa**
**caitanya-caritāmṛta kahe kṛṣṇa-dāsa**
— *Cc. Ādi 1.110*


This is the process. He does not say that "I have understood Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu directly." No. That is not understanding. That is foolishness. You cannot understand what is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore repeatedly he says, **rūpa-raghunātha-pade yāra āśa** **caitanya-caritāmṛta kahe kṛṣṇa-dāsa** — *Cc. Ādi 1.110*. "I am that Kṛṣṇa dāsa Kavirāja who is always under the subordination of the Gosvāmīs." This is **paramparā** system.

Similarly, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura also says, **ei chay gosāi jār tār mui dās** [Nāma-saṅkīrtana 6]: "I am servant of that person who has accepted this six Gosvāmīs as his master."

*Key Insight: Understanding Bhagavad-gītā requires following the paramparā system, accepting the direct words of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His representatives.*
