### 📖 The Highest Perfectional Stage of Life

**Prabhupāda:** Even the very question is so nice that it is the best subject matter for hearing. Simply by such questioning and hearing one can achieve the highest perfectional stage of life. Because Lord Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Person, any question about Him is original and perfect. Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that the highest perfection of life is to achieve the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa. Because questions and answers about Kṛṣṇa elevate one to the transcendental position, the questions of Mahārāja Parīkṣit about Kṛṣṇa philosophy are greatly glorified. Mahārāja Parīkṣit wanted to absorb his mind completely in Kṛṣṇa, and such absorption can be effected simply by hearing about the uncommon activities of Kṛṣṇa. For instance, in the **Bhagavad-gītā** it is stated that simply by understanding the transcendental nature of Lord Kṛṣṇa's appearance, disappearance, and activities, one can immediately return back to home, back to Godhead.

**Prabhupāda:** They do not know what is back to home, back to Godhead. Home is here in India, and again back to Godhead? And somebody says, "Here is America. It is my home." And when you say that he'll be kicked out after some years, then home finished. They are satisfied, that home finished, that's all. In such ignorance they are living. And for this home they are busy.

SHLOKA:

**gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām**
**apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ**
**gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām**

— *SB 2.1.2*

**Prabhupāda:** **Gṛhamedhī**, attached to this home, from which he'll be kicked out. Kṛṣṇa says, "I'll take it out, everything." **Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham** (*Bg. 10.34*). "I come before you as death and take everything, whatever you have got." That's a fact. Everyone is accumulating, but at the time of death he'll be forced to give it up. He'll be forced to give up the body which he is maintaining so nicely. That he is experiencing. Still, **apaśyatām ātma-tattvam**. Because he does not know what is self-interest, he remains ignorant and dies. This is going on. And leaders—

SHLOKA:

**andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ**

— *SB 7.5.31*

**Prabhupāda:** Blind leaders, they are encouraging, "Yes, kick yourself. You live here as nationalist. This is your interest. And fight between one nation to one nation, one man to one man." And they have taken this is value. **Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām** (*SB 2.1.2*).

**Yaśomatīnandana:** 

SHLOKA:

**śrotavyādīni rājendra**
**nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ**
**apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ**
**gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām**

— *SB 2.1.2*

**Prabhupāda:** See newspaper? Hundreds of thousands of news. Here they are ten pages. In foreign countries, such a big bundle. **Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ** (*SB 2.1.2*). Thousands and thousands news. But no news about **ātma-tattvam**. That is not to be taken. They do not know. So many newspapers. Therefore they are purchasing our books. They are intelligent. They are seeing something new. That is, they are intelligent men. Because they have never seen such books. There is elaborate science of God. One can go back to home, back to Godhead. You can talk with Him, you can eat with Him.

*Key Insight: Ignorance of self-interest and attachment to material home leads to suffering.*
