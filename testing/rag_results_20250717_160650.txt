5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Humble Greetings, dear devotee! 

As we delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada, let us first acknowledge the immense gratitude we owe to our beloved spiritual master for illuminating the path of self-realization. 

‚ú® The Struggle with Meditation 

In Bhagavad-gita 12.5, Srila Prabhupada sheds light on the challenges we face in our meditation practice. He reminds us that "For one who has taken his birth, death is certain; and for one who has died, birth is certain. Therefore, what is the use of lamentation?" [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/bg/12/5.txt) This verse highlights the futility of worrying about the inevitable cycle of birth and death. Instead, we should focus on the present moment and strive to make progress on our spiritual journey.

‚ú® The Restless Mind 

The mind, as Srila Prabhupada explains, is inherently restless and difficult to control. In the translation of Bhagavad-gita 12.5, he writes, "For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/bg/12/5.txt) This verse underscores the importance of cultivating a personal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, rather than merely attempting to merge with an impersonal energy.

‚ú® The Guidance of a Guru 

In our pursuit of spiritual growth, the guidance of a genuine guru is indispensable. As Srila Prabhupada states in Topmost Yoga System 1, "The yoga system, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, is not for sense gratification, but for self-realization, and the self-realization which is described, that is the highest form of yoga, that is, to understand Krsna, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tys/1.txt/) A bonafide guru helps us navigate the complexities of spiritual life, providing us with the necessary wisdom and support to overcome obstacles like the restless mind.

‚ú® Reflection and Practical Application 

As we reflect on these teachings, let us remember that spiritual progress is not a solo endeavor. We need the guidance of a guru and the support of like-minded devotees to overcome the challenges we face. By focusing on our personal relationship with Krsna and seeking the wisdom of our spiritual master, we can make steady progress on our journey of self-realization. 

May we humbly approach Srila Prabhupada's teachings, and may his guidance illuminate our path towards spiritual growth and self-realization.
