TEXT: from his father, "Oh, what is this? What is that?" We may have a very good spiritual master, but if we have no power to inquire, we cannot make progress. Nor should the inquiry be of the nature of a challenge. One should not think, "Now I will see what kind of spiritual master he is. I will challenge him." Our inquiries (//paripraśnena//) should be on the subject of service (//sevayā//). Without service, our inquiries will be futile, but even before making inquiries, we should have some qualification. If we go to a store to purchase some gold or jewelry and we know nothing about jewels or gold, we are likely to be cheated. If we go to a jeweler and say, "Can you give me a diamond?" he will understand that this is a fool. He could charge us any price for anything. That kind of searching will not do at all. We first have to become a little intelligent, for it is not possible to make spiritual progress otherwise. The beginning injunction of the //Vedānta-sūtra// is: //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// "Now is the time to inquire about Brahman." The word //atha// means that one who is intelligent, who has come to the point of realizing the basic frustrations of material life, is capable of making inquiry. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is stated that one should inquire from a spiritual master about subjects that are "beyond this darkness." This material world is by nature dark, and it is artificially lighted by fire. Our inquiries should be about the transcendental worlds which lie beyond this universe. If one is desirous to find out about these spiritual worlds, he should seek out a spiritual master; otherwise there is no point in searching. If I want to study //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Vedānta-sūtra// in order to make material improvement, it is not necessary to find a spiritual master. One should first want to inquire about Brahman and then search out a master who has perfect vision of the Absolute Truth (//jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]). Kṛṣṇa is the supreme //tattva,// Absolute Truth. In the Seventh Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// Śrī Kṛṣṇa states: > manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu > kaścid yatati siddhaye > yatatām api siddhānāṁ > kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ "Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those

REFERENCE: chapter1 (Raja-Vidya)

TEXT: This is not only theoretical knowledge but practical knowledge (//vijñāna-sahitam//). Whatever knowledge we receive from //Bhagavad-gītā// should not be taken for sentimentality or fanaticism. The knowledge is both //jñāna// and //vijñāna,// theoretical wisdom and scientific knowledge. If one becomes well-versed in this knowledge, liberation is certain. Life in this material world is by nature inauspicious and miserable. //Mokṣa// means liberation, and the promise is that by dint of understanding this knowledge one will attain liberation from all miseries. It is important then to understand what Kṛṣṇa says about this knowledge. {{page>books:bg:9:2#text}} **"This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed."** [[books:bg:9:2|(Bg. 9.2)]] According to //Bhagavad-gītā,// the topmost knowledge (//rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyam//) is Kṛṣṇa consciousness because in //Bhagavad-gītā// we find that the symptom of one who is actually in knowledge is that he has surrendered unto Kṛṣṇa. As long as we go on speculating about God but do not surrender, it is understood that we have not attained the perfection of knowledge. The perfection of knowledge is: {{page>books:bg:7:19#text}} **"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare."** [[books:bg:7:19|(Bg. 7.19)]] As long as we do not surrender, we cannot understand God. Surrender to God may take many births, but if we accept that God is great, it is possible to surrender unto Him immediately. But generally this is not our position in the material world. We are characteristically envious and consequently think, "Oh, why should I surrender unto God? I am independent. I shall work independently." Therefore in order to rectify this misgiving, we have to work for many births. In this regard, the name of Kṛṣṇa is especially significant. //Kṛṣ// means "repetition of birth," and //ṇa// means "one who checks." Our repetition of birth can be checked only by God. No one can check his repetition of birth and death without the causeless mercy of God. The subject matter of the Ninth Chapter is //rāja-vidyā. Rāja// means "king," and //vidyā// means "knowledge." In ordinary life we find

REFERENCE: chapter5 (Raja-Vidya)

TEXT: Arjuna was not a great scholar at all, nor was he a //yogī,// meditator or a holy man. He was a warrior about to engage in battle. There were many great sages living at the time, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa could have given //Bhagavad-gītā// to them. The answer is that despite being an ordinary man, Arjuna had one great qualification: //bhakto 'si me sakhā ceti:// "You are My devotee and My friend." This was Arjuna's exceptional qualification, a qualification which the sages did not have. Arjuna knew that Kṛṣṇa was the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and therefore he surrendered himself unto Him, accepting Him as his spiritual master. Unless one is a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa's, he cannot possibly understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// If one wants to understand //Bhagavad-gītā,// he cannot take help from other methods. He must understand it as prescribed in //Bhagavad-gītā// itself, by understanding it as Arjuna understood it. If we wish to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// in a different way, or give an individual interpretation, that may be an exhibition of our scholarship, but it is not //Bhagavad-gītā.// By scholarship we may be able to manufacture some theory of //Bhagavad-gītā,// just as Mahātmā Gandhi did when he interpreted //Bhagavad-gītā// in an effort to support his theory of nonviolence. How is it possible to prove nonviolence from //Bhagavad-gītā?// The very theme of //Bhagavad-gītā// involves Arjuna's reluctance to fight and Kṛṣṇa's inducing him to kill his opponents. In fact, Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna that the battle had already been decided by the Supreme, that the people who were assembled on the battlefield were predestined never to return. It was Kṛṣṇa's program that the warriors were all destined to die, and Kṛṣṇa gave Arjuna the opportunity of taking the credit of conquering them. If fighting is proclaimed a necessity in //Bhagavad-gītā,// how is it possible to prove nonviolence from it? Such interpretations are attempts to distort //Bhagavad-gītā.// As soon as the //Gītā// is interpreted according to the motive of an individual, the purpose is lost. It is stated that we cannot attain the conclusion of the Vedic literature by the force of our own logic or argument. There are many things which do not come within the jurisdiction of our sense of logic. As far as scriptures are concerned, we find different scriptures describing the Absolute Truth in different

As we delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada's Raja-Vidya book, we are reminded of the importance of spiritual inquiry, the role of a spiritual master, and the nature of transcendental knowledge. Let us explore these essential points together.

✨ The Foundation of Spiritual Progress

✨ The Qualification for Spiritual Inquiry

The Vedānta-sūtra sets the tone for spiritual inquiry with the injunction *"athāto brahma jijñāsā. 'Now is the time to inquire about Brahman.'"* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/7.txt/) This emphasizes that spiritual inquiry is not a casual pursuit, but rather a deliberate and timely endeavor.

✨ The Nature of Transcendental Knowledge

Srila Prabhupada describes the nature of transcendental knowledge as *"the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/1.txt/) This underscores the significance of spiritual knowledge, which is not only the pinnacle of education but also the key to self-realization.

✨ The Ultimate Goal: Surrender to Kṛṣṇa

Srila Prabhupada reminds us that the ultimate goal of spiritual inquiry is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. He quotes the Bhagavad-gītā, *"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/rv/1.txt/) This highlights the importance of recognizing Kṛṣṇa as the ultimate authority and surrendering to Him.

✨ The Importance of Devotion

Let us strive to cultivate devotion to Kṛṣṇa and surrender to Him, recognizing Him as the ultimate authority. By doing so, we can deepen our understanding of spiritual knowledge and make progress on our spiritual journey.
