5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila, 5.6**

**Invocation**

om ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā
caksur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī-gurave namah

"I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance, with the torch of knowledge." (Sri Caitanya-caritamrta, Adi-lila, 1.1)

**The Appearance of Lord Caitanya**

In the sacred land of Navadvīpa, a most wondrous event took place. The original Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appeared as Lord Caitanya, the golden avatāra. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "That original Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared in Navadvīpa as Lord Caitanya..." (CC Adi 5.6, Translation) [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/5/6.txt)

**The Expansion of Balarāma: Lord Nityānanda**

Accompanying Lord Caitanya was His eternal associate, Lord Nityānanda. Srila Prabhupada reveals, "...and Balarāma appeared with Him as Lord Nityānanda." (CC Adi 5.6, Translation) [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/cc/adi/5/6.txt) This expansion of Balarāma, the elder brother of Lord Kṛṣṇa, played a vital role in the Lord's pastimes.

**Reflection**

The appearance of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda is a testament to the Lord's infinite mercy. By understanding the significance of Their appearance, we can deepen our appreciation for the Lord's divine pastimes and the importance of Their association. As Srila Prabhupada often emphasized, the chanting of the holy names of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda is the most effective means of spiritual advancement in this age of Kali. May we take shelter of Their divine mercy and strive to follow in the footsteps of the Lord's devotees.

**Practical Application**

Let us take a moment to reflect on the significance of Lord Caitanya's appearance and the role of Lord Nityānanda in His pastimes. As we chant the holy names of the Lord, let us remember the importance of Their association and strive to cultivate a deeper appreciation for Their divine mercy.
