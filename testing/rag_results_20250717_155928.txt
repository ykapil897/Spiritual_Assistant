üïâ Srila Prabhupada's Guidance on the Ultimate Goal of Life

My dear devotee, let us take a moment to reflect on the ultimate goal of life. Srila Prabhupada, our beloved spiritual master, has so kindly guided us on this essential topic.

‚ú® The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the Ultimate Goal

As Srila Prabhupada so beautifully states in Srimad-Bhagavatam 9.5.6, *"The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna, is the ultimate goal of life."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/sb/9/5/6.txt) This is the foundation of our spiritual journey. We must understand that Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the ultimate goal we strive for.

‚ú® Devotional Service: The Means to Attain the Ultimate Goal

But how do we attain this ultimate goal? Srila Prabhupada explains in the purport of Srimad-Bhagavatam 9.5.6, *"One should engage in devotional service to attain the ultimate goal of life, Krsna."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/sb/9/5/6.txt) Devotional service, or bhakti-yoga, is the process by which we can reconnect with Krsna and ultimately attain Him.

‚ú® The Only Means to Attain Krsna

Srila Prabhupada further emphasizes the importance of devotional service, stating, *"The process of devotional service is the only means to attain the ultimate goal of life, Krsna."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/sb/9/5/6.txt) This is not just one of many options; it is the only means to attain the ultimate goal of life.

**Reflection**

My dear devotee, let us take a moment to reflect on these essential teachings. Srila Prabhupada has so kindly guided us on the ultimate goal of life and the means to attain it. Let us strive to engage in devotional service, following in the footsteps of our beloved spiritual master, and ultimately attain the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna.
