**Controlling Material Senses**

**Prabhupāda:** If anyone wants to enjoy spiritual senses, then he has to control these material senses. That is the yoga system. Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ. By yoga practice, one controls the material senses. And when the yoga is complete, then the activities of the spiritual senses begin.

**Spiritual Bliss**

**Prabhupāda:** Just like in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā. Brahma-bhūtaḥ means the material sense gratification stopped. That is, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām (Bg. 18.54). So after the activities of the material senses stopped, then the spiritual senses begin to work. So when from that spiritual senses we derive bliss, that is wanted. That is real ānanda.

**Purifying the Existence**

**Prabhupāda:** To enjoy the spiritual sense, one has to not only stop, but undergo tapasya, tapo divyam. Just like a man is diseased, he wants to eat, but due to the disease he cannot eat. So first of all, you have to cure the disease, then your eating will be a pleasure. And if you want to eat in the diseased condition, then the taste will not be proper; you cannot eat. A man suffering from jaundice, if you give him sugar candy, he will taste it bitter. The same man, when he is cured, he will taste the sugar candy as very sweet. Tapo divyaṁ yena putrakā śuddhyed sattvam (SB 5.5.1). You have to purify your existence by tapasya. And tapasya means stops material sense gratification.

**Understanding Bhagavad-gītā**

**Dr. Movebhed:** Yes. [referring to translating Bhagavad-gītā into Farsi]

**Prabhupāda:** So Bhagavad-gītā... Kṛṣṇa is speaking Bhagavad-gītā. What is the position of Kṛṣṇa? That you have mentioned?

**Dr. Movebhed:** I have to listen to you. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:** Why you shall listen to me? The Bhagavad-gītā is there.

**Dr. Movebhed:** But you are an insider. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:** Yes, actually without listening, so many big, big men, they have committed mistake about Bhagavad-gītā. Even Gandhi, he says that "I do not believe that there was a person Kṛṣṇa ever living." Just see. What to speak of others. [Hindi] Without listening from the right source, even a personality like Gandhi will commit mistake, what to speak of others. Similarly, Dr. Radhakrishnan has committed so many mistakes. So big, big scholars, they're trying to study Bhagavad-gītā, but they cannot understand.

**The Importance of Surrender**

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā (Bg. 4.34). You first prepare yourself to surrender, praṇipāta, praṇipāta, prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa nipāta. Without any reservation, surrender, praṇipātena, by the surrendering process, and paripraśnena, by enquiring from the authority. Because it is not very easy to understand Kṛṣṇa. Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye (Bg. 7.3). Out of many, many million persons, one tries to understand, one trying to become perfect, siddhaye. Siddhi means perfection. So yatātām api siddhānām (Bg. 7.3): "Those who have attained siddhi, perfection, out of many such siddhas," kaścid māṁ vetti tattvataḥ, "maybe one man can understand Me." The first of all to become siddha. Then, after becoming siddha, one may understand Kṛṣṇa or he may not. Actually, it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. But you can understand Kṛṣṇa if you adopt this process: praṇipātena, paripraśnena, sevayā---three things.

_Key Insight: To experience spiritual bliss, one must control material senses through yoga and tapasya, and then surrender to the authority to understand the divine._

**Transcending Material Life**

So our tendency for sense gratification is controlled. Therefore, it is called license. **Gṛhastha** life means a license for sense gratification. But then we must know that sense gratification means material life. It may be systematic or not systematic, sense gratification means material life. But our aim is to transcend this material life and come to the spiritual life, the platform of spiritual life. That is required.

**The Mystic Yoga System**

So there are so many processes. So that is being discussed by Kṛṣṇa. Here He is especially referring to the mystic **yoga** system, **indriyāgniṣu juhvati**, controlling the senses.

**The Futility of Artificial Yoga**

So this controlling the senses, the simple method is that artificially if you want to practice **yoga** like Viśvāmitra Muni or Durvāsā Muni, very great... There are many big, big stories about these **munis** who were big, big **yogīs**. This Durvāsā Muni traveled all over the universe, and he went beyond the universe in the spiritual world. He saw Lord Viṣṇu personally. Still, he was defeated. There are many stories. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja.

**The Dangers of the Senses**

**Durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī.** But these **indriyas** cannot do any harm to you if you take the poison teeth of this deadly snake. Poison teeth. **Indriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta...** What is that? What is the process of taking away the poison teeth? That is **bhakti-yoga**. That is **bhakti-yoga**. That means **sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam, hṛṣīkeṇa...** [[Cc. Madhya 19.170]].

**Engaging the Senses in the Service of the Lord**

**Hṛṣīkeśa** means **indriya. Hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam.** You cannot control the senses unless you engage your senses in the service of the senses of the Lord. The Lord has got senses. He is also a living being like us. But less intelligent class, they cannot understand. They think that something must be opposite. No. The Vedic information is **nityo nityānām:** "The Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is also eternal." That is explained in the **Bhagavad-gītā** also.

**The Eternality of the Individual**

Bhagavān says that "Arjuna, you and Me and all these people who have gathered here, we are **nitya**. We were present in the past, and we are now in the battlefield, and when we give up this body, we shall again remain the same, individual." That is explained in the Second Chapter. This individuality continues. There is no such information that all of them become one by amalgamation. That is not possible, because in the **Bhagavad-gītā** it..., **mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ** [[Bg. 15.7]]. **Aṁśaḥ**, the particles of the Supreme, they are **sanātanaḥ**. It is not that by chance the spirit, whole spirit, has been broken into pieces. No. That is not possible. Because in the **Bhagavad-gītā** you will find, **acchedyo 'yam:** "It cannot be broken into pieces." Then how it became pieces? Therefore these piecemeal, the small particles of the original whole, they are **sanātanaḥ**. It is not that by circumstance it has become small pieces. No.

**The Spiritual Molecules**

And when they amalgamate... Just like they give the example that the water, when it is put into the water, again it becomes one. But scientifically, they are molecules. They remain separate. Even the sunshine, they are simply combination of shining molecules. Similarly, we are also like that, shining spiritual molecules.

_Key Insight: True control of the senses comes not through artificial yoga practices but by engaging them in the service of the Lord, and individuality continues eternally as spiritual molecules._

**The Imperfect Senses**

**Prabhupāda:** Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that this body is a network of ignorance, simply sense gratification: "I shall eat this. I shall eat that. I shall hear this. I shall..." The ear is engaged in hearing nice cinema songs, and the tongue is engaged in going to the restaurant, so many so-called palatable dishes. Similarly, other senses, they are engaged.

**The Importance of Controlling the Tongue**

**Prabhupāda:** According to the bhakti-yoga system, the first control is recommended to the tongue. That is said, that ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ (Cc. Madhya 17.136). Now, we receive knowledge through the indriyas, but if the indriyas are impure—senses, they are impure—they cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

**Hearing and Chanting**

**Prabhupāda:** Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi. Na, beginning. Because beginning is śravaṇam. Bhakti-mārga begins by hearing. Now, what is śravaṇam? Chanting. If there is chanting or there is some speaking, then we can hear. That is recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that simply hear.

**The Obstacles to Spiritual Growth**

**Prabhupāda:** But it is said, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ. These present blunt senses, material senses, cannot receive even this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. They say, "This is nuisance." Bhagavān says in the Bhagavad-gītā, catur-vidhā bhajante mām: "Four classes of men who begin bhagavad bhajana," sukṛtina, "those who are pious..." But the modern leaders, they say, "This bhajana nuisance." This is our misfortune.

**The Glorification of Hari**

**Prabhupāda:** Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ (Bg. 9.14). These are the explanations in the Bhagavad-gītā. Saintly person, mahātmā, they are engaged in chanting satatam, always. Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām (Bg. 9.14). Kīrtayantaḥ, glorifying. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ. Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ (Cc. Ādi 17.31). This is the recommendation.

**Overcoming Obstacles**

**Prabhupāda:** But we are meeting so many obstacles because they think, "This chanting is nuisance. This bhajana is nuisance. This is Kali-yuga. Not the Kali-yuga; even every yuga." So ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ (Cc. Madhya 17.136). A devotee is hearing, he is enjoying, and the nondevotee is thinking, "It is nuisance." Therefore it is said, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ. The blunt senses, material senses, they cannot receive. Nāmādi. Not only name; they cannot see Lord Kṛṣṇa's form.

**The Solution**

**Prabhupāda:** Then how to understand Kṛṣṇa? That is recommended, sevonmukhe hi jihvādau. You have to engage your tongue first of all in the service of the Lord. The Kṛṣṇa realization begins from the tongue. How? Now you simply make it a vow, that "I shall not accept anything that is not offered to Kṛṣṇa." And you take another vow, that "I shall not talk anything except glorifying the Lord." Then you become perfect. Very simple method. Simply you have to make this determination, that "I shall not talk anything which is not about Kṛṣṇa, and I shall not eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa."

_Key Insight: To understand Kṛṣṇa, one must purify their senses, especially the tongue, by engaging it in the service of the Lord through chanting and eating only prasādam._

Here is the formatted and restored transcript:

**The Importance of Tapasya**

**Prabhupāda:** That is what _tapasya_ means — we should restrict sense gratification. Sense gratification, either regulated or non-regulated, is meant for animal life. Sense control is the human life. Therefore, you'll find in Vedic culture big, big learned scholars, big, big kings, they dedicated their life for _tapasya_.

**Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam** (SB 5.5.1). If you want to purify your existence, then you must take to the process of _tapasya_. _Tapasya_ is for realization of God. And then we shall be purified.

**Purification Means Eternal Life**

**Prabhupāda:** What is the meaning of purification, purification? Purification means we are eternal, and if we become purified from this material contamination, then we get back our eternal life, back to home, back to Godhead. That is required. That is... For that, we have to accept little _tapasya_. Not to become sense gratifiers like the dogs and hogs. That is not civilization.

**Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye** (SB 5.5.1). This human life should be regulated in such a way that he hasn't got to satisfy the senses after taking so much hard labor. The modern civilization is like that. Everyone is engaged in hard labor simply for satisfaction of the senses. So they have become mad.

**The Consequences of Sense Gratification**

**Prabhupāda:** _Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vi..._ And they are acting without any consideration of the effect. They do not consider whether it is sinful or not. They do not believe in the next life. They do not discriminate what is sinful, what is pious—nothing. Exactly like animals. So _śāstra_ says, "This is not good." Here also, Devahūti says that _bhūmann asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt. Asad-indriya-tarṣ..._ Actually, these senses are not real senses. It is covered, just like my this body, covered with this shirt or this cloth. It is not my real body. Although you see the shirt has got a hand, that hand is not real hand. The real hand is within the shirt. Similarly, our real body is within this body.

**The Real Body**

**Prabhupāda:** _Dehino 'smin yathā dehe_ (Bg. 2.13). _Dehinaḥ. Dehinaḥ_ means the real body, or the spiritual body of the soul, is within this body. _Dehino 'smin yathā dehe._ And the body is changing. _Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā._ It is sometimes child, sometimes youth, sometimes a young man, sometimes old man. And then vanishes. It is... There are six changes. So this is not real body. But... And we are engaged in this unreal body, sense gratification. We have got senses. So therefore _Bhagavad-gītā_ says, _sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam_ (Bg. 6.21). _Atīndriya-grāhyam._ Beyond the senses. Therefore, these senses are to be purified. That is called _tapasya. Tapo divyam_ (SB 5.5.1). And...

**Purifying the Senses**

**Prabhupāda:** _Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam._ When we purify our senses... Senses you cannot destroy. That is not possible. Just like some..., somebody said that "You become desireless." Desireless... Desire is the mental activities. So we cannot be desireless. That is not possible. We have to purify the desire. That is required. That is recommended, _sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate_ (Cc. Madhya 19.170).

_Key Insight: Tapasya, or self-control, is essential to purify our existence and attain eternal life, free from material contamination._

**The Dangers of Sense Gratification**

The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other anarthas, drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. Therefore if you will give us some chance...

**The Balance Between Sense Gratification and Spirituality**

**Mr. Loomis:** I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not.

**Prabhupāda:** Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10]. Sense gratification is required as far as, as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification. Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest. But not that we shall sleep twenty-four hours or twenty hours and enjoy, as in this country sometimes they enjoy sleeping. But sleeping is wasting time. So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized. You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called tapasya, or advancement of spiritual life.

**The Four Basic Needs**

Eating, sleeping, sex, and defense. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased. That is tapasya. In the human life this is possible, this is possible. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. One can conquer over these things, by practice.

**Conquering the Senses**

The more we minimize this āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna, this means we are advanced in spiritual taste. It is practiced. My, my personal life, I don't sleep at night. And nowadays, at most, one hour. Yes. But I take rest in the daytime, at least two to three hours. So it is not that I am sleeping one hour. I sleep three to four hours total. But if practiced, it can be reduced, practiced. We see in the life of Gosvāmīs. About them, it is said: nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. They conquered over sleeping, eating. If we conquer over eating, then we can conquer over sleeping and other things also. If we can control over this tongue, then we can control over the other senses very easily. That is a fact.

**The Importance of Controlling the Tongue**

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre. Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent. So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the śāstra also it is said sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ [Brs. 1.2.234]. Our present senses are unable to understand śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi, the holy name of the Lord.

_Key Insight: Sense gratification can never be truly fulfilling and should be minimized as much as possible to make progress in spiritual life._

Here is the reformatted text:

**Controlling Material Senses**

**Prabhupāda:** If anyone wants to enjoy spiritual senses, then he has to control these material senses. That is the yoga system. Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ. By yoga practice, one controls the material senses. And when the yoga is complete, then the activities of the spiritual senses begin.

**Spiritual Bliss**

**Prabhupāda:** Just like in the Bhagavad-gītā it is said, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā. Brahma-bhūtaḥ means the material sense gratification stopped. That is, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām (Bg. 18.54). So after the activities of the material senses stopped, then the spiritual senses begin to work. So when from that spiritual senses we derive bliss, that is wanted. That is real ānanda.

**Purifying the Existence**

**Prabhupāda:** To enjoy the spiritual sense, one has to not only stop, but undergo tapasya, tapo divyam. Just like a man is diseased, he wants to eat, but due to the disease he cannot eat. So first of all, you have to cure the disease, then your eating will be a pleasure. And if you want to eat in the diseased condition, then the taste will not be proper; you cannot eat. A man suffering from jaundice, if you give him sugar candy, he will taste it bitter. The same man, when he is cured, he will taste the sugar candy as very sweet. Tapo divyaṁ yena putrakā śuddhyed sattvam (SB 5.5.1). You have to purify your existence by tapasya. And tapasya means stops material sense gratification.

**Understanding Bhagavad-gītā**

**Dr. Movebhed:** Yes. [referring to translating Bhagavad-gītā into Farsi]

**Prabhupāda:** So Bhagavad-gītā... Kṛṣṇa is speaking Bhagavad-gītā. What is the position of Kṛṣṇa? That you have mentioned?

**Dr. Movebhed:** I have to listen to you. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:** Why you shall listen to me? The Bhagavad-gītā is there.

**Dr. Movebhed:** But you are an insider. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:** Yes, actually without listening, so many big, big men, they have committed mistake about Bhagavad-gītā. Even Gandhi, he says that "I do not believe that there was a person Kṛṣṇa ever living." Just see. What to speak of others. [Hindi] Without listening from the right source, even a personality like Gandhi will commit mistake, what to speak of others. Similarly, Dr. Radhakrishnan has committed so many mistakes. So big, big scholars, they're trying to study Bhagavad-gītā, but they cannot understand.

**The Importance of Surrender**

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā (Bg. 4.34). You first prepare yourself to surrender, praṇipāta, praṇipāta, prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa nipāta. Without any reservation, surrender, praṇipātena, by the surrendering process, and paripraśnena, by enquiring from the authority. Because it is not very easy to understand Kṛṣṇa. Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye (Bg. 7.3). Out of many, many million persons, one tries to understand, one trying to become perfect, siddhaye. Siddhi means perfection. So yatātām api siddhānām (Bg. 7.3): "Those who have attained siddhi, perfection, out of many such siddhas," kaścid māṁ vetti tattvataḥ, "maybe one man can understand Me." The first of all to become siddha. Then, after becoming siddha, one may understand Kṛṣṇa or he may not. Actually, it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. But you can understand Kṛṣṇa if you adopt this process: praṇipātena, paripraśnena, sevayā---three things.

_Key Insight: To experience spiritual bliss, one must control material senses through yoga and tapasya, and then surrender to the authority to understand the divine._

**Transcending Material Life**

So our tendency for sense gratification is controlled. Therefore, it is called license. **Gṛhastha** life means a license for sense gratification. But then we must know that sense gratification means material life. It may be systematic or not systematic, sense gratification means material life. But our aim is to transcend this material life and come to the spiritual life, the platform of spiritual life. That is required.

**The Mystic Yoga System**

So there are so many processes. So that is being discussed by Kṛṣṇa. Here He is especially referring to the mystic **yoga** system, **indriyāgniṣu juhvati**, controlling the senses.

**The Futility of Artificial Yoga**

So this controlling the senses, the simple method is that artificially if you want to practice **yoga** like Viśvāmitra Muni or Durvāsā Muni, very great... There are many big, big stories about these **munis** who were big, big **yogīs**. This Durvāsā Muni traveled all over the universe, and he went beyond the universe in the spiritual world. He saw Lord Viṣṇu personally. Still, he was defeated. There are many stories. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja.

**The Dangers of the Senses**

**Durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī.** But these **indriyas** cannot do any harm to you if you take the poison teeth of this deadly snake. Poison teeth. **Indriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta...** What is that? What is the process of taking away the poison teeth? That is **bhakti-yoga**. That is **bhakti-yoga**. That means **sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam, hṛṣīkeṇa...** [[Cc. Madhya 19.170]].

**Engaging the Senses in the Service of the Lord**

**Hṛṣīkeśa** means **indriya. Hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam.** You cannot control the senses unless you engage your senses in the service of the senses of the Lord. The Lord has got senses. He is also a living being like us. But less intelligent class, they cannot understand. They think that something must be opposite. No. The Vedic information is **nityo nityānām:** "The Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is also eternal." That is explained in the **Bhagavad-gītā** also.

Bhagavān says that "Arjuna, you and Me and all these people who have gathered here, we are **nitya**. We were present in the past, and we are now in the battlefield, and when we give up this body, we shall again remain the same, individual." That is explained in the Second Chapter. This individuality continues. There is no such information that all of them become one by amalgamation. That is not possible, because in the **Bhagavad-gītā** it..., **mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ** [[Bg. 15.7]]. **Aṁśaḥ**, the particles of the Supreme, they are **sanātanaḥ**. It is not that by chance the spirit, whole spirit, has been broken into pieces. No. That is not possible. Because in the **Bhagavad-gītā** you will find, **acchedyo 'yam:** "It cannot be broken into pieces." Then how it became pieces? Therefore these piecemeal, the small particles of the original whole, they are **sanātanaḥ**. It is not that by circumstance it has become small pieces. No.

**The Spiritual Molecules**

And when they amalgamate... Just like they give the example that the water, when it is put into the water, again it becomes one. But scientifically, they are molecules. They remain separate. Even the sunshine, they are simply combination of shining molecules. Similarly, we are also like that, shining spiritual molecules.

_Key Insight: True control of the senses comes not through artificial yoga practices but by engaging them in the service of the Lord, and individuality continues eternally as spiritual molecules._

**The Imperfect Senses**

**Prabhupāda:** Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that this body is a network of ignorance, simply sense gratification: "I shall eat this. I shall eat that. I shall hear this. I shall..." The ear is engaged in hearing nice cinema songs, and the tongue is engaged in going to the restaurant, so many so-called palatable dishes. Similarly, other senses, they are engaged.

**The Importance of Controlling the Tongue**

**Prabhupāda:** According to the bhakti-yoga system, the first control is recommended to the tongue. That is said, that ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ (Cc. Madhya 17.136). Now, we receive knowledge through the indriyas, but if the indriyas are impure—senses, they are impure—they cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

**Hearing and Chanting**

**Prabhupāda:** Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi. Na, beginning. Because beginning is śravaṇam. Bhakti-mārga begins by hearing. Now, what is śravaṇam? Chanting. If there is chanting or there is some speaking, then we can hear. That is recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that simply hear.

**The Obstacles to Spiritual Growth**

**Prabhupāda:** But it is said, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ. These present blunt senses, material senses, cannot receive even this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. They say, "This is nuisance." Bhagavān says in the Bhagavad-gītā, catur-vidhā bhajante mām: "Four classes of men who begin bhagavad bhajana," sukṛtina, "those who are pious..." But the modern leaders, they say, "This bhajana nuisance." This is our misfortune.

**The Glorification of Hari**

**Prabhupāda:** Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ (Bg. 9.14). These are the explanations in the Bhagavad-gītā. Saintly person, mahātmā, they are engaged in chanting satatam, always. Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām (Bg. 9.14). Kīrtayantaḥ, glorifying. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ. Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ (Cc. Ādi 17.31). This is the recommendation.

**Overcoming Obstacles**

**Prabhupāda:** But we are meeting so many obstacles because they think, "This chanting is nuisance. This bhajana is nuisance. This is Kali-yuga. Not the Kali-yuga; even every yuga." So ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ (Cc. Madhya 17.136). A devotee is hearing, he is enjoying, and the nondevotee is thinking, "It is nuisance." Therefore it is said, ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ. The blunt senses, material senses, they cannot receive. Nāmādi. Not only name; they cannot see Lord Kṛṣṇa's form.

**The Solution**

**Prabhupāda:** Then how to understand Kṛṣṇa? That is recommended, sevonmukhe hi jihvādau. You have to engage your tongue first of all in the service of the Lord. The Kṛṣṇa realization begins from the tongue. How? Now you simply make it a vow, that "I shall not accept anything that is not offered to Kṛṣṇa." And you take another vow, that "I shall not talk anything except glorifying the Lord." Then you become perfect. Very simple method. Simply you have to make this determination, that "I shall not talk anything which is not about Kṛṣṇa, and I shall not eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa."

_Key Insight: To understand Kṛṣṇa, one must purify their senses, especially the tongue, by engaging it in the service of the Lord through chanting and eating only prasādam._

**The Importance of Tapasya**

**Prabhupāda:** That is what _tapasya_ means — we should restrict sense gratification. Sense gratification, either regulated or non-regulated, is meant for animal life. Sense control is the human life. Therefore, you'll find in Vedic culture big, big learned scholars, big, big kings, they dedicated their life for _tapasya_.

**Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam** (SB 5.5.1). If you want to purify your existence, then you must take to the process of _tapasya_. _Tapasya_ is for realization of God. And then we shall be purified.

**Purification Means Eternal Life**

**Prabhupāda:** What is the meaning of purification, purification? Purification means we are eternal, and if we become purified from this material contamination, then we get back our eternal life, back to home, back to Godhead. That is required. That is... For that, we have to accept little _tapasya_. Not to become sense gratifiers like the dogs and hogs. That is not civilization.

**Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye** (SB 5.5.1). This human life should be regulated in such a way that he hasn't got to satisfy the senses after taking so much hard labor. The modern civilization is like that. Everyone is engaged in hard labor simply for satisfaction of the senses. So they have become mad.

**The Consequences of Sense Gratification**

**Prabhupāda:** _Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vi..._ And they are acting without any consideration of the effect. They do not consider whether it is sinful or not. They do not believe in the next life. They do not discriminate what is sinful, what is pious—nothing. Exactly like animals. So _śāstra_ says, "This is not good." Here also, Devahūti says that _bhūmann asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt. Asad-indriya-tarṣ..._ Actually, these senses are not real senses. It is covered, just like my this body, covered with this shirt or this cloth. It is not my real body. Although you see the shirt has got a hand, that hand is not real hand. The real hand is within the shirt. Similarly, our real body is within this body.

**The Real Body**

**Prabhupāda:** _Dehino 'smin yathā dehe_ (Bg. 2.13). _Dehinaḥ. Dehinaḥ_ means the real body, or the spiritual body of the soul, is within this body. _Dehino 'smin yathā dehe._ And the body is changing. _Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā._ It is sometimes child, sometimes youth, sometimes a young man, sometimes old man. And then vanishes. It is... There are six changes. So this is not real body. But... And we are engaged in this unreal body, sense gratification. We have got senses. So therefore _Bhagavad-gītā_ says, _sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam_ (Bg. 6.21). _Atīndriya-grāhyam._ Beyond the senses. Therefore, these senses are to be purified. That is called _tapasya. Tapo divyam_ (SB 5.5.1). And...

**Purifying the Senses**

**Prabhupāda:** _Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam._ When we purify our senses... Senses you cannot destroy. That is not possible. Just like some..., somebody said that "You become desireless." Desireless... Desire is the mental activities. So we cannot be desireless. That is not possible. We have to purify the desire. That is required. That is recommended, _sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate_ (Cc. Madhya 19.170).

_Key Insight: Tapasya, or self-control, is essential to purify our existence and attain eternal life, free from material contamination._

**The Dangers of Sense Gratification**

The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other anarthas, drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. Therefore if you will give us some chance...

**The Balance Between Sense Gratification and Spirituality**

**Mr. Loomis:** I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not.

**Prabhupāda:** Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kāmasya nendriya-prītir [SB 1.2.10]. Sense gratification is required as far as, as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification. Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest. But not that we shall sleep twenty-four hours or twenty hours and enjoy, as in this country sometimes they enjoy sleeping. But sleeping is wasting time. So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized. You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called tapasya, or advancement of spiritual life.

**The Four Basic Needs**

Eating, sleeping, sex, and defense. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased. That is tapasya. In the human life this is possible, this is possible. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. One can conquer over these things, by practice.

**Conquering the Senses**

The more we minimize this āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna, this means we are advanced in spiritual taste. It is practiced. My, my personal life, I don't sleep at night. And nowadays, at most, one hour. Yes. But I take rest in the daytime, at least two to three hours. So it is not that I am sleeping one hour. I sleep three to four hours total. But if practiced, it can be reduced, practiced. We see in the life of Gosvāmīs. About them, it is said: nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. They conquered over sleeping, eating. If we conquer over eating, then we can conquer over sleeping and other things also. If we can control over this tongue, then we can control over the other senses very easily. That is a fact.

**The Importance of Controlling the Tongue**

Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre. Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent. So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the śāstra also it is said sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ [Brs. 1.2.234]. Our present senses are unable to understand śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi, the holy name of the Lord.

_Key Insight: Sense gratification can never be truly fulfilling and should be minimized as much as possible to make progress in spiritual life._
