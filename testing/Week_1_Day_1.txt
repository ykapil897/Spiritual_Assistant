### 📖 Helping Others Through Devotional Service

**Prabhupāda:** Is that all right, what he said? So, how to help them?

**Devotee:** First we give them the chanting, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm?

**Devotee:** First we give them the **mahā-mantra**.

**Prabhupāda:** **Mahā-mantra**, one may not accept.

**Bhāgavata:** We have to find the ways and the means by which we can make pure devotional service attractive to each living entity according to his particular...

**Prabhupāda:** Unless one feels necessity, why they will accept your proposal, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa"? How you'll make them feeling, "Yes, it is necessary"? That is wanted. Otherwise, anyone will say, some proposition, "You do this." Then why they will accept it?

**Devotee:** Hmm. We have to make...

**Prabhupāda:** Unless he feels that... That requires philosophy. If you say something dogmatic, why they'll accept? You say that "You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," he'll say, "I have no interest. I have no interest. Why shall I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?"

**Devotee:** Tell them that they are eternal spirit soul.

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm?

**Devotee:** You tell them that you are eternal spirit soul. Tell them about the eternal spiritual world, the eternal spiritual...

**Prabhupāda:** That you have to convince, that "You are eternal, but you are falsely engaged in temporary business." That you have to tell them.

**Bhāgavata:** We have to give them knowledge. Knowledge consists of telling them what is the field, who is the knower of the field, and who is the super-knower of the field. Once they get knowledge, knowledge is the preliminary step to executing devotional service. Once they have knowledge, then they will be able to execute devotional service. And Rūpa Goswami says that one who executes devotional service in knowledge, he increases his knowledge.

### 📖 The Field and the Knower of the Field

**Bhāgavata:** Therefore the first thing is we should give them knowledge, and knowledge means to understand this body, the owner of the body and the supreme owner of the body, Kṛṣṇa.

SHLOKA:

**puṛuṣa prakṛti caiva**
**kṣetra kṣetrajñam eva ca**
**etad veditum icchāmi**
**jñāna jñeya ca keśava**
— *Bg. 13.1*

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm?

**Bhāgavata:** And Kṛṣṇa answers him. He says that **ida śarīra kaunteya**, "My dear son of Kuntī, **śarīraṁ**, this body, **kṣetrajñaṁ...**"

**Prabhupāda:** Not "My dear Kuntī."

**Bhāgavata:** "My dear son of Kuntī."

**Prabhupāda:** Yes.

**Bhāgavata:** **Kṣetram ity abhidhīyate**, that "This body is known as the field." **Kṣetram ity abhidhīyate. Etad yo vetti ta prāhu kṣetrajña iti tad-vidaḥ**, that "This body is known as the field, and one who knows this field, he is the knower of the field, he is the knower of the body."

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm. So how to explain? Everyone is acting. How he is acting on the field, that is stated next verse. Field of activities. In English it is called field of activity.

*Key Insight: To help others, we must first make them feel the necessity of spiritual life, and then provide them with knowledge of their eternal spiritual nature and the temporary nature of the material world.*
