He descended to disseminate transcendental knowledge for the benefit of the whole human race.** The word //ātma-prajñaptaye// indicates that the Lord descends for the benefit of the human race to give transcendental knowledge. Material necessities are quite sufficiently provided for in the knowledge given in the Vedic literatures, which offer a program for good living and gradual elevation to the platform of //sattva-guṇa,// the mode of goodness. Once one is situated in //sattva-guṇa,// one's knowledge expands. On the platform of passion there is no knowledge, for passion is an impetus to enjoy material benefits. On the platform of ignorance there is neither knowledge nor enjoyment but simply animalistic living. The //Vedas// are intended to elevate one from the mode of ignorance to the platform of goodness. When one is situated in the mode of goodness, he is able to understand knowledge of the self, or transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge cannot be appreciated by any ordinary man; therefore a disciplic succession is required. This knowledge is expounded either by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself or by His bona fide devotee. Śaunaka Muni also states here that Kapila, the incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, took birth or appeared simply to disseminate transcendental knowledge. To understand that one is not matter but spirit soul (//ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// \"I am by nature Brahman\") is not sufficient for understanding the self and his activities. One must be situated in the activities of Brahman. Knowledge of those activities is explained by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. Such transcendental knowledge can be appreciated in human society but not in animal society, as clearly indicated here by the word //nṛṇām, \"for// the human beings.\" Human beings are meant to lead a regulated life. By nature, there is regulation in animal life also, but that is not like the regulative life described in the scriptures or by the Vedic authorities. Only when one's life is regulated according to the //Vedas// can one understand transcendental knowledge. For the propagation of this transcendental knowledge, Kapiladeva, the incarnation",

Later, another Kapiladeva appeared who expounded atheistic Sāṅkhya philosophy, which dealt with the twenty-four elements but gave no information about God. The original Kapila is called the Devahūti-putra Kapila, and the other is called the atheist Kapila. Concerning Kapiladeva, Śaunaka Ṛṣi says, //kapilas tattva-saṅkhyātā.// Kapila is the Supreme Person; therefore He can explain the Absolute Truth. Actually only Bhagavān can know the true position of the ultimate truth. No one else can know it. Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa or His incarnation, occasionally visits the earth to give humanity information about the aim of life. Thus the Supreme Lord descended as Kapiladeva, //tattva-saṅkhyātā.// The word //saṅkhyātā// means \"expounder,\" and //tattva// means \"the Absolute Truth.\" The Absolute Truth is Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. We cannot understand the Absolute Truth or the Supreme Person by mental speculation, especially when we are under the influence of the three modes of material nature (//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa//). Only those who are situated in //sattva-guṇa// (the mode of goodness) are fit to understand the Absolute Truth. According to //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:42|(18.42)]], those possessing brahminical qualifications are situated in //sattva-guṇa.// > śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ > kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca > jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ > brahma-karma svabhāva jam \"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge and righteousness---these are the qualities by which the //brāhmaṇas// work.\" According to the Vedic conception, there must be men in society who are factually //brāhmaṇas,// capable of expounding the real truth. If everyone becomes a //śūdra,// the Absolute Truth cannot be understood. It is said that at the present moment in Kali-yuga everyone is a //śūdra// (//kalau śūdra-sambhavāḥ//), and it is very difficult in this age to find qualified //brāhmaṇas,// for they are very rare. There is practically not a single qualified //brāhmaṇa// in this age. > prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya > kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ > mandāḥ sumanda-matayo > manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ \"O learned one, in this iron age of Kali men have but short lives.

His father's name was Kardama Muni. After Kapiladeva grew up, His father, according to the Vedic system, retired, took //sannyāsa// and left home to cultivate spiritual life. It is not that one should rot in this material world throughout one's whole life. //pañcāśordhvaṁ vanaṁ vrajet.// According to the Vedic injunctions, there are four //āśramas// and four //varṇas,// and these used to be followed very strictly. After his son grew up, Kardama Muni, being a strict follower of the //Vedas,// left home and put his wife in the charge of his grown son, Kapiladeva.

    "text": "very cheaply because the word is misused, but actually Bhagavān is not an ordinary man. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ:// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]] because Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa appeared as a human being, fools and rascals (//mūḍhas//) consider Kṛṣṇa an ordinary human. As Kṛṣṇa Himself states in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:13|(7.13)]]: > tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair > ebhiḥ sarvam idaṁ jagat > mohitaṁ nābhijānāti > mām ebhyaḥ param avyayaṁ \"Deluded by the three modes (goodness, passion and ignorance), the whole world does not know Me, who am above the modes and inexhaustible.\" Yet there are //mahātmās,// great souls, who can understand Kṛṣṇa. Arjuna could understand that although Kṛṣṇa was playing the part of his friend, He was nonetheless the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna was in perfect knowledge, yet Kṛṣṇa instructed him for our benefit. Arjuna requested Kṛṣṇa's instructions, which are set forth for all human society. After hearing //Bhagavad-gītā,// Arjuna addressed Kṛṣṇa as //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]], \"the Supreme Brahman and supreme abode.\" Every person is actually Brahman, spirit soul. We are not actually the body. Awareness of //ahaṁ brahmāsmi// (\"I am Brahman\") is actual self-realization. According to Vedic culture, one must understand that he is Brahman, not the body. We should not remain in ignorance like cats and dogs, thinking, \"I am this body, I am American, I am Indian, I am //brāhmaṇa,// I am //kṣatriya,// I am Hindu, I am Muslim,\" and so on. These are all bodily designations. When one comes to spiritual understanding, he understands //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// \"I am Brahman.\" This is called Brahman realization. It is not that we become Brahman by some practice. Gold is gold, even if it is covered with some dirt, which can certainly be removed. Similarly, we are all Brahman, spirit soul, but somehow or other we have come in contact with these material elements (//bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]), and we have acquired bodily coverings. Consequently we think, \"I am this body.\" This is ignorance, and unless one is enlightened by spiritual knowledge, he remains animalistic. Understanding one's spiritual identity is called //dharma.// The ultimate goal of //dharma// is enunciated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:66|(18.66)]]. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// \"Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.\" On this earth we have created so many //dharmas//---Hindu //dharma,// Muslim //dharma,// Christian",

Such a great soul is very rare.\" The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for the propagation of this message. We are not preaching a particular sectarian religious system but a real religion, //dharma. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam:// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]] no one actually knows what //dharma// is, and no one can manufacture //dharma. Dharma// is the order of the Supreme Being. No one can manufacture state laws; they are given by the government. The simplest definition of //dharma// is that //dharma// is the order of the Supreme Being. Since the Supreme Being, God, is one, His order must be one. How, then, can there be different //dharmas?// It is not possible. Different //dharmas// are created due to ignorance, which causes people to think in terms of Hindu //dharma,// Muslim //dharma,// Christian //dharma,// this //dharma// or that //dharma.// No. Gold is gold. If a Christian possesses some gold, does it become Christian gold? Gold is gold whether possessed by a Hindu, a Muslim or a Christian. According to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //dharma// means surrendering unto that Supreme Being. This is //bhāgavata-dharma,// and everyone should be taught how to surrender unto God. God is one; there cannot be two Gods. When there is competition, there is no God. Presently there is a different God on every street, but Kṛṣṇa is not that kind of God. He is the Supreme God. As Kṛṣṇa Himself states in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:7|(7.7)]]: > mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat > kiñcid asti dhanañjaya > mayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ > sūtre maṇi-gaṇā iva \"O conqueror of wealth [Arjuna], there is no truth superior to Me. Everything rests upon Me, as pearls are strung on a thread.\" The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to inform everyone that no one is superior to Kṛṣṇa, God.

We have simply presented this information, saying, \"Here is God. Śrī Kṛṣṇa.\" Because they have taken this seriously, many young Americans and Europeans are advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Consequently many people are surprised to see how Americans and Europeans have become such great devotees and are dancing in ecstasy. How is it they are so advanced? They have taken the information seriously: //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Whether one touches fire blindly or knowingly, fire will burn. It is not that because the fire is touched by a child, fire will not burn. These young Westerners have touched fire, and consequently it is acting as fire. //Ācāryopāsanam:// this information (//kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam//) is not concocted, but is accepted by the //ācāryas// in the disciplic succession. Although an impersonalist, Śaṅkarācārya has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So have Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Nimbārka and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His followers. They all accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme, just as Arjuna himself did. This is the simplest method. There is no need to speculate, \"What is God? Where is God?\" Why foolishly go on searching? Here is God---Kṛṣṇa. We may think that Kṛṣṇa cannot be seen, but Kṛṣṇa can appear in the form of His energy. Of course, a stone is not God, but a stone is another one of God's energies. Heat and light are not fire, but without fire there cannot be heat or light. In that sense, heat and light are nondifferent from fire. This material world is like the heat and light of the supreme fire. > eka-deśa-sthitasyāgner > jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā > parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis > tathedam akhilaṁ jagat \"Just as a fire is situated in one place, but spreads illumination all around, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Parabrahman, spreads His energies throughout this universe.\" (//Viṣṇu Purāṇa// 1.22.53) The sun is situated in one place, and its light and heat expand throughout the entire solar system. As soon as we perceive light and heat, we can understand that the sun is there.

Because people are foolish in this age, they cannot understand that when we perceive the energy of the Lord, we can feel the presence of the Lord. The young devotees in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are presently worshiping Kṛṣṇa. What are the signs of a devotee? The actual sign of a devotee is that he is no longer interested in material enjoyment: //bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca// (SB 11.2.42). The disciples of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement do not go to cinemas, restaurants or clubs, and they do not smoke or drink. In European and American countries all these things are available and are very cheap, but these young people are not interested in them. They are simply interested in sitting on the floor and learning about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why is this? They have actually rejected the material world. When one comes to detest material enjoyment, one can understand that he has advanced spiritually. Spiritual life does not mean taking //sannyāsa// and then smoking or drinking tea. One must actually come to detest material life. One comes to lose interest in material activities and becomes interested only in the understanding of God, the Supreme Being, and His service. As enjoined in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|(5.5.1)]]: > nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke > kaṣṭān kāmān arhate vid-bhujāṁ ye \"Of all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for the dogs and hogs that eat stool.\" The word //vid-bhujām// means \"stooleaters.\" Hogs work hard day and night simply eating stool, and because stool contains chemicals, hydrophosphates, the hog gets strength, becomes very fat and enjoys sex. In any case, human life is meant not for imitating the life of a hog but for //tapasya,// austerity: > tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ > śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam > [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]] \"Rather, my dear boys, one should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service.

The society of //varṇāśrama-dharma//---composed of //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, gṛhasthas, vānaprasthas, brahmacārīs// and //sannyāsīs//---is meant to elevate people gradually to the perfect stage of understanding God. The whole aim of the different //varṇas// and //āśramas// is the worship of the Supreme Lord. One can attain this understanding through this social system, which admits of gradations. When one goes to school, he begins with the first grade, then progresses to the second, third and so forth. In this way one makes progress. When human society accepts //varṇāśrama-dharma,// it can gradually come to the understanding of Brahman. By birth, everyone is a //śūdra;// therefore everyone has to be educated. The word //dvija// means \"twiceborn.\" One is first born through the womb of a mother, and one's next birth is given by the spiritual master and Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is the mother, and the spiritual master is the father. When one is twice-born (//dvija//), he receives a sacred thread from the spiritual master and begins to learn about spiritual life. He is then allowed to read the Vedic literatures. In this way one becomes a son of Vedic literature. //Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam: [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]] Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the essence of Vedic culture. It is a wish-fulfilling tree, and we can take whatever we want from it. Vedic knowledge is perfect, and if we want to come to know it, we must take shelter of a bona fide //guru// (//tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]). Unfortunately, in this age everything is mismanaged. people forget the aim of life, and at such a time the Supreme Lord Himself comes. The Supreme Lord descends out of compassion because He is more anxious to have us return home, back to Godhead, than we are to go. Because we are in ignorance, we do not know anything about the kingdom of God. We know nothing about how to get there or how to become happy. We have forgotten all this. Therefore Kṛṣṇa comes at intervals or sends His representative, the pure devotee. Sometimes He comes personally, and sometimes He sends His incarnation. Kapiladeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is stated: //kapilas tattva-saṅkhyātā bhagavān ātma-māyayā.// The word //māyā//",

We have to accept a certain type of body because we are forced to do so, but this is not the case with Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Presently I may have a human form, but in the future I cannot demand a human form. We receive bodies in the next life according to //karma,// not will. One cannot demand to be a high-court judge unless one has been educated for the job. First of all, one must become qualified. If one qualifies himself, one may become a //devatā,// a demigod like Indra or Candra, or one can become a dog or a cat. That depends on one's //karma,// or activities (//karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]). When Kṛṣṇa or His incarnation come, they do not depend on //karma// for their bodies. The Supreme Lord is above //karma// and is fully independent. It is therefore said, //ātma-māyayā.// The Supreme Lord comes by His own energy, not by the external energy or by force. When the governor visits the prison, he is not forced to do so. He is not to be considered a condemned person; rather, he goes by his own good will just to see how things are going on, However, it is understood that when an ordinary person is placed in jail, he is sent there by force because he has been proven a criminal.

In our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we have over a hundred centers, and Kṛṣṇa is maintaining them all. None of our devotees are employed for independent incomes, yet they are all being maintained. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa never says, \"Do this or that, and I will then maintain you.\" Rather, He states that not only will He maintain us, but He will also protect us from the results of sin, from sinful //karma// [[books:bg:18:66|(Bg. 18.66)]]. All of this assurance is there. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovidaḥ.// The word //kovidaḥ// means \"intelligent.\" An intelligent person should try to attain shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Human life is actually meant for getting in touch with the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That should be our only business. The word //upari// indicates the higher planetary systems. There are seven higher planetary systems, and we are in the middle system, in Bhūrloka. Within this one universe, there are fourteen planetary systems, and the living entities are wandering in different bodily forms on different planets. According to //karma,//",

We do not have to work independently to maintain the body. > tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukhaṁ > kālena sarvatra gabhīra-raṁhasā Our actual endeavor should be to attain happiness; that is our real struggle for existence. According to the //śāstras: tal labhyate duḥkhavat.// The word //duḥkhavat// indicates that although we do not want misery, misery comes anyway. We don't have to endeavor separately for misery. No one says, \"Let there be a fire in my house\" or \"Let my child die.\" No one aspires after these things, yet they happen. Everyone is thinking, \"May my child live happily\" or \"May I get so much money.\" We do not ask or pray for catastrophes, yet they come without invitation. Similarly, whatever happiness is there for our enjoyment will also come without our asking for it. The conclusion is that we should not endeavor for so-called happiness or distress, but should try to attain that position whereby we can understand Kṛṣṇa and get shelter at His lotus feet. This should be the real human endeavor. It was Caitanya Mahāprabhu who said to Rūpa Gosvāmī: > brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva > guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja \"The living entity is wandering up and down, from one planet to another, and he is very fortunate if by the mercy of the spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa Himself he can get the seed of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa.\" [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|(Cc. Madhya 19.151)]] The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an attempt to make people fortunate. In this age, everyone is unfortunate (//manda-bhāgyāḥ//), but now we are trying to reverse the situation. Throughout the world there are problems everywhere. One country has one type of problem, and another country has another. There is strife within governments themselves, and even presidents are fraught with problems.

We may laugh because President Nixon is in trouble, and we may think ourselves very safe because we have a big bank balance, but actually no one is safe. Eventually everyone will dry up and be thrown in the fire. That is a fact. We may survive for a few years, but we cannot avoid death. In fact, it is said, \"As sure as death.\" And what is the result of death? One loses everything---all honor, money, position and material life itself. Kṛṣṇa states in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:34|(10.34)]], //mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham:// \"I am all-devouring death.\" Kṛṣṇa comes as death and plunders everything---bank balance, skyscrapers, wife, children and whatever.

Śaunaka Ṛṣi requested Sūta Gosvāmī to describe what he had actually heard from his spiritual master, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, about the transcendental pastimes that the Lord manifested by His internal energy. Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has no material body, but He can assume any kind of body by His supreme will. That is made possible by His internal energy. We can understand the pastimes of the Lord by following one or some of the authorized devotional processes. > śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ > smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam > arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ > sakhyam ātma-nivedanam \"Hearing, chanting and remembering the holy name, form, pastimes, qualities and entourage of the Lord, offering service according to the time, place and performer, worshiping the Deity, offering prayers, always considering oneself the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, making friends with Him and dedicating everything unto Him---these are the nine processes of devotional service.\" [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|(SB 7.5.23)]] There are nine basic processes of devotional service---hearing and chanting about the Supreme Lord, remembering Him, serving His lotus feet, worshiping Him, offering prayers to the Lord, acting as His servant, becoming His friend, and surrendering everything to Him. The beginning is //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,// hearing and chanting. One must be very eager to hear and chant.

As Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:2|(10.2)]], //aham ādir hi devānām:// \"I am the source of the demigods.\" The most important demigods (//devas//) are Brahmā, Śiva and Viṣṇu. In the beginning of the creation there is Lord Viṣṇu, and from Lord Viṣṇu, Brahmā is born. From Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva is born, and these three gods take charge of the three modes of material nature. Viṣṇu takes charge of //sattva-guṇa// (the mode of goodness), Lord Brahmā takes charge of //rajo-guṇa// (the mode of passion), and Lord Śiva takes charge of //tamo-guṇa// (the mode of ignorance). However, before the creation there was no Brahmā or Śiva. There was only Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa therefore says, //aham ādir hi devānām// [Bg 10.2]. He is the creator of all demigods and all other living entities. After the cosmic manifestation is created, the living entities are placed in it. Therefore in the //Vedas// it is stated that in the beginning there was neither Brahmā nor Śiva, but only Nārāyaṇa (//eko nārāyaṇa āsīt//). Nārāyaṇa is also another plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa. We have to learn from the scriptures that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam:// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]] all the //viṣṇu-tattvas// and incarnations are but plenary expansions or expansions of the plenary expansions of Kṛṣṇa. There are millions and millions of incarnations. They are as plentiful as waves in the ocean. There are //śaktyāveśa-avatāras, guṇa-avatāras// and //svayam-avatāras,// and these are all described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// All these //avatāras,// or incarnations, are //svacchandātmā,// free from care and anxiety. If we organize a business, we have many anxieties. The managing director or proprietor of the business particularly has many anxieties. Although he sits in his office without disturbance, he is not very happy because he is always thinking about how to do this or that, how to manage this affair or that. This is material nature, and therefore it is said that there is always anxiety in the material world. When Hiraṇyakaśipu, the father of prahlāda Mahārāja, asked his son, \"My dear boy, what is the best thing you have learned from your teachers?\" Prahlāda Mahārāja immediately replied, //tat sādhu manye 'sura-varya dehināṁ sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt// [[books:sb:7:5:5|(SB 7.5.5)]]. \"I",

This is the Vedic injunction. The material world is //asad-vastu;// it cannot possibly remain. In the material world, everything will ultimately be vanquished. Whatever exists in the material world exists only for some time. It is temporary. The Māyāvādī philosophers say, //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā:// \"The Supreme Truth is real, whereas the world is false\"---but Vaiṣṇavas do not use the word //mithyā// (false), because God, the Supreme Brahman, is truth, and nothing false can emanate from the truth. If we prepare an earring from gold, the earring is also gold. We cannot say that the earring is false. //Yato imāni bhūtāni jāyante:// the Supreme Absolute Truth is He from whom everything is emanating. If everything is emanating from the Absolute Truth, nothing can actually be false. The Vaiṣṇava philosophers accept the world as temporary, but not false, as the Māyāvādī philosophers do. The world (//jagat//) has emanated from the Supreme; therefore it is not //mithyā,// but it is temporary. That is also explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:19|(8.19)]]: //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate.// The material world comes into existence, remains for some time, and is then annihilated. It is not false, for it can be utilized to realize the Supreme Truth. This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. The world is temporary, but we must use it for spiritual purposes. If something is used for the ultimate truth, the Absolute Truth, it becomes integral with the Absolute Truth. As stated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī (//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// 1.2.255-256): > anāsaktasya viṣayān > yathārham upayuñjataḥ > nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe > yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate > > prāpañcikatayā buddhyā > hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ > mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo > vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate The word //mumukṣubhiḥ// refers to those who aspire for //mukti,// liberation. When one becomes disgusted with material engagement, one wants to destroy everything that has anything to do with the material world. However, the Vaiṣṇava says, //prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.// Everything has some relationship with the Supreme Person, the Absolute Truth. For instance, a microphone is made of metal, but what is metal? It is another form of earth.

They are not. A Vaiṣṇava will never say that metal has no connection with Kṛṣṇa. It is a product of one of His energies, just as this material world is a product of the sun. We cannot say that the sunshine is false and that the sun is true. If the sun is true, the sunshine is also true. Similarly, we do not say that the material universe is false. It may be temporary, but it is not false. Therefore the Gosvāmīs and Kṛṣṇa Himself tell us that since everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, everything should be utilized for His purpose. This creation emanates from Bhagavān, the Supreme Lord, who is without anxiety. Kṛṣṇa very pleasantly associates with His consort Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and enjoys playing His flute. If God is anxious, what kind of God is He? Even Lord Brahmā and other demigods are anxious. Lord Brahmā is engaged in meditation, Lord Siva dances to annihilate the universe, the goddess Kālī is engaged in killing with her sword, and so forth. The demigods have many activities, but Kṛṣṇa is always peaceful. The Kṛṣṇa who engages in killing demons is Vāsudeva Kṛṣṇa, not the original Kṛṣṇa. The original Kṛṣṇa does not go anywhere; He never takes a step away from Vṛndāvana. The other activities performed by Kṛṣṇa are performed in the Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha or Pradyumna forms. Kṛṣṇa expands as Saṅkarṣaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.

When an important man wants to get something done, he simply tells his secretary, who does everything. The important man is quite confident that because he has told his secretary, his desires will be carried out. The secretary is a person, energy (//śakti//).

They were trained in such a way that they were not ordinary men but were called //naradeva. Naradeva// refers to Bhagavān in the form of a human being.

If he does not, he thinks that eating, sleeping, sex and defense are all in all. In this case, his subjects live like animals. Today no one knows the object of human life; therefore although the foolish people of this age are trying to be happy, their hopes will never be fulfilled. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]].

Being encouraged and pleased by Vidura's inquiry about transcendental knowledge, Maitreya spoke as follows.** Questions and answers are very satisfactorily dealt with when the inquirer is bona fide and the speaker is also authorized. Here Maitreya is considered a powerful sage, and therefore he is also described as //bhagavān.// This word can be used not only for the Supreme Personality of Godhead but for anyone who is almost as powerful as the Supreme Lord. Maitreya is addressed as //bhagavān// because he was spiritually far advanced. He was a personal friend of Dvaipāyana Vyāsadeva, a literary incarnation of the Lord. Maitreya was very pleased with the inquiries of Vidura because they were the inquiries of a bona fide, advanced devotee. Thus Maitreya was encouraged to answer. When there are discourses on transcendental topics between devotees of equal mentality, the questions and answers are very fruitful and encouraging. This is the Vedic process for receiving knowledge. One must approach the proper person, the //guru,// and submissively listen to him expound transcendental knowledge. As Śrī Kṛṣṇa advises in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:4:34|(4.34)]]: > tad viddhi praṇipātena > paripraśnena sevayā \"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him.\" Transcendental knowledge is not very difficult, but the process must be known. Sometimes a dictating machine or a typewriter may not work, but if we go to a technician who knows the machine, he can immediately repair it. The process must be known. If one goes to a ditchdigger to repair a dictating machine, he cannot help. He may know how to dig ditches, but not repair a machine. Therefore the //śāstras// enjoin that if one wants transcendental knowledge, one must approach the proper person. The word //tad-vijñāna// refers to transcendental knowledge, not material knowledge. A medical practitioner may have material knowledge of the body, but he has no knowledge of the spirit soul within. He simply studies the mechanical arrangement of the body, which is a machine (//yantra//) made by nature. The body is actually stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:18:61|(18.61)]] to",

Whatever he wants, he can immediately produce in his hand, and he can travel wherever he desires. Kardama Muni was such a perfected //siddhi-yogi.// By his wife, Devahūti, he had nine daughters, who were distributed to the prajāpatis like Dakṣa Mahārāja and many others. The only son of Kardama Muni was Kapiladeva, an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. This Kapiladeva was one of the //mahājanas.// The word //mahājana// means \"authority,\" and according to the Vedic //śāstras// there are twelve authorities. These are Svayambhū, Nārada, Śambhu, Kumāra, Kapila, Manu, prahlāda, Janaka, Bhīṣma, Bali, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Yamarāja. Svayambhū is Brahmā, and Śambhu is Lord Śiva. These authorities should be followed if we want to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead and understand the purpose of religious life. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. These //mahājanas// follow the principles set forth by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, in //Bhagavad-gītā.// We cannot very easily understand the actual truth of religious systems, but if we follow these //mahājanas,// we can understand. Kapila Muni explained the glories of devotional service to His mother, Devahūti. If we follow Him, we may learn the truth of devotional service. According to the system of //varṇāśrama-dharma,// one who is over fifty years of age must leave home, go to the forest and completely devote his life to spiritual realization. This is the actual //varṇāśrama-dharma// system. It is not a Hindu system, for the word \"Hindu\" is a name given by the Muslims and does not occur in any Vedic literature. However, the //varṇāśrama-dharma// is mentioned. Civilized human beings should strictly follow the //varṇāśrama// institution. If one is born a //brāhmaṇa,// he is trained nicely as a //brahmacārī,// and then he becomes a //gṛhastha,// a householder. When he gives up his home, he is called a //vānaprastha,// and after that he may take //sannyāsa.// Being a //yogī,// Kardama Muni strictly followed these principles; therefore as soon as Kapiladeva was grown, Devahūti was placed in His charge. Kardama Muni then left home. As stated in this verse: //pitari prasthite 'raṇyaṁ mātuḥ priya-cikīrṣayā.// According to the //Manu-saṁhitā,// a woman should never be given freedom. When she is",

A woman cannot be happy if she is independent. That is a fact. In Western countries we have seen many women very unhappy simply for the sake of independence. That independence is not recommended by the Vedic civilization or by the //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Consequently Devahūti was given to her grown son, Kapiladeva, and Kapiladeva was fully aware that He had to take care of His mother. It is the duty of the father to protect his daughter until she attains puberty and is married to a suitable young man. The husband then takes care of the wife. Generally a man should marry at around twenty-five years of age, and a girl should marry no later than sixteen. If this is the case, when the man is fifty years old, his eldest son should be around twenty-five, old enough to take charge of the mother. According to this calculation, Kapiladeva was about twenty-five years old and was quite able to take charge of His mother, Devahūti. He knew that because His father left His mother in His charge, He should take care of her and always please her. //Mātuḥ priya-cikīrṣayā.// Kapiladeva was not irresponsible, but was always ready to please His mother. Kapiladeva was a //brahmacārī,// and His mother took lessons from Him. That is the prerogative of the male. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:32|(9.32)]]: > māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya > ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ > striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās > te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim \"O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth---women, //vaiśyas// [merchants] as well as //śūdras// [workers]---can approach the supreme destination.\" Women are considered on the same platform with //śūdras,// and although a woman may be married to a //brāhmaṇa,// she is not given the sacred thread. It is also said that the //Mahābhārata// was compiled by Vyāsadeva because the direct Vedic knowledge could not be understood by women, //śūdras// and //dvija-bandhus,// those who are born in //brāhmaṇa// families but are not qualified //brāhmaṇas.

It is therefore said: //mātuḥ priya-cikīrṣayā.// The son is always ready to see that the mother is not unhappy. Kapiladeva was anxious that His mother not feel the absence of His father, and He was ready to take the best care of her and give her knowledge. Because women are supposed to be less intelligent, they should be given knowledge, and they should also follow this knowledge. They should follow their father's instructions, their husband's instructions and the instructions of their grown, scholarly sons like Kapiladeva. In this way, their lives can be perfect. In all cases, women should always remain dependent. //Tasmin bindusare 'vātsīd bhagavān kapilaḥ kila.// It is noteworthy that in this verse Kapiladeva is referred to as Bhagavān, which indicates that He possesses all wealth, fame, knowledge, beauty, strength and renunciation. These six opulences are fully represented in Kṛṣṇa; therefore Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]), and others are accepted as His expansions, or incarnations (//viṣṇu-tattva//). In //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// Rūpa Gosvāmī has analyzed the characteristics of Bhagavān. The first Bhagavān is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, but some of His opulences are also bestowed upon Lord Brahmā. Lord Brahmā is a //jīva-tattva,// a living being like us. If we become spiritually powerful, we can also have the post of Lord Brahmā. Superior to Lord Brahmā is Lord Śiva, and superior to Lord Śiva is Viṣṇu, or Lord Nārāyaṇa, and superior to all is Kṛṣṇa. That is the analysis of the Vedic //śāstras// and //Brahma-saṁhitā.// Even Śaṅkarācārya, the Māyāvādī impersonalist philosopher, accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (//sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ//). All the //ācāryas//---Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Nimbārka and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu---also accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord. Kapiladeva is an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, and He gave instructions to His mother, Devahūti. We must distinguish between the two Kapilas. One Kapila is this Bhagavān Kapila, and the other Kapila is the atheist Kapila. Bhagavān Kapila is also known as Devahūti-putra Kapila. Both Kapilas expounded Sāṅkhya philosophy, but the atheist Kapila expounded it without understanding, perception or realization of God.",

Looking at a mountain from a distance, we may see a hazy cloud, and if we come nearer, we may see something green. If we actually climb the mountain, we will find many houses, trees and animals. Our vision is of the same mountain, but due to our different positions we see haze, greenery or variegatedness. In the final stage, there are varieties---trees, animals, men, houses, and so on. The Absolute Truth is not without variety. Just as there is material variety, there is spiritual variety. Because the Māyāvādī philosophers are seeing the Absolute Truth from a distance, they think that the Absolute Truth has no variety. They consider variety to be material, but this is a misunderstanding. The Absolute Truth is described as variegated in //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.29): > cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa- > lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam > lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ > govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi \"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, fulfilling all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of desire trees.

They become Nārāyaṇa, but for want of anything better to do, for want of variegatedness, they take up material humanitarian activities.

This impersonal traveling is actually very agitating; similarly, impersonal realization of the Absolute Truth cannot be permanent because one wants variety. A falldown is inevitable.

He has given us a very simple method: //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. We need only chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. To perfect this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, there is no hard-and-fast rule. Simply by chanting, we will attain perfection. Being contaminated by Kali-yuga, however, we are unfortunate and therefore we have no attraction to the holy names of Kṛṣṇa.

Kapiladeva was an incarnation of God and was a young boy; therefore His face was very beautiful. When He answered this question, He became even more beautiful, and He smiled because He was pleased at His mother's question. Kṛṣṇa is also very beautiful, but when a devotee serves Him and comes to Him, He becomes even more beautiful. When a devotee with all his heart and soul serves Kṛṣṇa, dresses Him in nice garments and gives Him a flower, Kṛṣṇa smiles. If you can get Kṛṣṇa to smile upon you just once, your life's goal is fulfilled. Thus smiling, Kapiladeva began to enlighten His mother. ===== Text 13 ===== > śrī-bhagavān uvāca > yoga ādhyātmikaḥ puṁsāṁ > mato niḥśreyasāya me > atyantoparatir yatra > duḥkhasya ca sukhasya ca > [[books:sb:3:25:13|[SB 3.25.13]]] **The Personality of Godhead answered: That yoga system which relates to the Lord and the individual soul, which is meant for the ultimate benefit of the living entity, and which causes detachment from all happiness and distress in the material world, is the highest yoga system.** In the material world, everyone is striving for some material happiness, but as soon as we get some material happiness, there is also material distress.

There is no question of material happiness or distress. It is transcendental. Lord Kapila will eventually explain how it is transcendental, but the preliminary introduction is given here. The attempt in this material world to maximize happiness and minimize distress is called the struggle for existence. Generally //yoga// is practiced to acquire some material profit. There are eight kinds of yogic perfection (//siddhis//): //aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti, īśitva, vaśitva, mahimā, prākāmya// and //kāmāvasāyitā.// A real //yogī// can become smaller than the smallest, lighter than the lightest and bigger than the biggest. Whatever he wants he can produce immediately in his hand. He can even create a planet. These are some of the //yoga-siddhis,// but here it is stated that the supreme //yoga// system does not aim at material happiness or relief from distresses caused by material inconvenience. Everyone is trying to get out of material distress and gain some happiness. In any case, when something is material, there is only so-called happiness and so-called distress. For instance, there may be fireworks going on, and this may be happiness for someone but distress for us. Some people are thinking that these fireworks are very enjoyable, and we are thinking that they are very inconvenient. That is the material world. On one side there is happiness, and on the other side there is distress. Both happiness and distress are actually illusions. In summer, water is happiness, but in winter it is distress. The water is the same, but at one time it brings happiness and at another time it brings distress. When a son is born, he brings happiness, but when he dies, he brings distress. In either case, the son is the same. This material world is the world of duality, and we cannot understand happiness without distress or distress without happiness. This is therefore called the relative world. Spiritual happiness is above these dualities, and that spiritual happiness is the perfection of //yoga. Yoga ādhyātmikaḥ. Yoga// is the happiness of the soul, and the individual soul can be happy when it is with the Supersoul, the Supreme Soul. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// (//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13).

Similarly, our real happiness is in enjoying with the Supreme Being. Happiness is being in His company. Kṛṣṇa is not alone, but is always with His friends, either the //gopīs// or the cowherd boys, or with His mother and father. We never find Kṛṣṇa alone. He may be with Rādhārāṇī or with His devotees.

Bhagavān makes no mistakes. //Nārāyaṇaḥ paro 'vyaktāt:// even Śaṅkarācārya says that \"Bhagavān, Nārāyaṇa, does not belong to this material world.\" When we speak of Bhagavān, or when the //śāstras// refer to Bhagavān, we refer to Him who is above material understanding.

Being imperfect, living entities are illusioned and subject to commit mistakes. They also have the tendency to cheat others. When one who has no knowledge tries to become a teacher or preacher, he is actually cheating others. Since we ourselves do not possess perfect knowledge, we simply try to teach what Śrī Bhagavān says. We do not manufacture our own teachings. So-called scholars and learned men manufacture their own teachings and give their opinions. In the West especially, we find much philosophical speculation and mental gymnastics, but such philosophy can never be perfect. We have to take our ideas from Bhagavān; then they will be perfect. We read //Bhagavad-gītā// because it is perfect. There is no mistake in it; there is no illusion in it; there is no cheating in it. Nor is it delivered by one whose senses are imperfect.

This simply requires that we clear our consciousness by thinking of Kṛṣṇa. The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to keep our minds constantly on Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is a person. When He was realized by Arjuna, He was addressed as //puruṣam.// God is //puruṣa,// male, not female. //puruṣa// means \"the enjoyer,\" and //prakṛti// means \"the enjoyed.\" Everything is enjoyed by the supreme //puruṣa.// It is also stated that we are actually //prakṛti,// not //puruṣa.// The human dress is simply //māyā,// illusion. We are thinking that we are //puruṣa,// the enjoyer, but actually we are the enjoyed. A man, thinking of enjoying himself, tries to imitate //puruṣa,// but actually he is //prakṛti.// As a consequence, he is cast into this material world. Because the living entity wants to enjoy the material world and is attached to the three //guṇas,// he receives different types of bodies. One who is in the mode of goodness receives the body of a learned //brāhmaṇa.// This is somewhat elevated, for he can gradually understand what is God. In the modes of passion and ignorance, no one can understand God. Also, from the material point of view, if one is situated in the mode of goodness, he can be elevated to higher planetary systems. Nonetheless, even if one goes to Brahmaloka, the highest planet in the material atmosphere, one is not actually perfectly situated. There is really no benefit because even on Brahmaloka the four miseries of material existence are found: birth, old age, disease and death. Lord Brahmā also dies and takes birth. From Vedic literatures we understand that Lord Brahmā took birth from the lotus flower generated from the navel of Viṣṇu. Thus he had his birth, and when Lord Brahmā dies, the entire material cosmic manifestation will be finished. Just as Lord Brahmā undergoes birth, old age, disease and death, so also a small ant or insect undergoes the same process. The point is that the living entity has to be free from this bondage because he is by nature eternal. According to //Bhagavad-gītā,// the living entity never actually takes",

One should not think that one is liberated because one can live millions and millions of years. The life of Lord Brahmā covers millions of earth years, yet he is also subjected to birth and death. That is the way of conditional life. We should take advantage of the perfect knowledge given by Vedic literatures, by the great //ṛṣis// and Bhagavān Kapiladeva, as well as by Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa, in order to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Receiving Kṛṣṇa consciousness means receiving light. People are exhausted with the materialistic way of life, especially in the West. Now the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is giving new life to Western society. By nature, we living entities are liberated. There is actually no question of birth, death, old age and disease. Since we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, how can there be a question of these things? Kṛṣṇa is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], and being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we are also of the same nature. We are equal in quality, although not in quantity. Why, then, should we suffer the pangs of death? Therefore in the previous verse Kapiladeva instructed: //yoga ādhyātmikaḥ puṁsāṁ mato niḥśreyasāya.// The soul is entrapped in the body, and the process of perfect //yoga// is the process of saving the soul from bodily confinement and the four miseries that plague the body.

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:9|(3.9)]]: > yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra > loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ > tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya > mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara \"Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.\" When people are in the modes of passion and ignorance, they perform //vikarma.// They do not care for their future lives, and they are habituated to eating anything and everything, just like hogs. They do not care for the śastric injunctions, and they are totally irresponsible. They are just like street boys who have no education and do not care for anything. Such urchins do whatever they like, for their fathers and mothers do not care for them. Life in ignorance, //tamo-guṇa,// is such a careless life. People simply act unlawfully, not considering the results of their actions. They act for sense gratification, and actually they take pleasure in committing sins.

Therefore not a single moment should be lost. Human life should be utilized only for chanting and reading Vedic literatures. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness is publishing many books so that people can utilize their time properly by reading them and make their lives successful.

As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the //jīva,// or the individual soul, is eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Just as the sun's rays are minute particles of the brilliant sun, so a living entity is a minute particle of the Supreme Spirit. The individual soul and the Supreme Lord are not separated as in material differentiation. The individual soul is a particle from the very beginning. One should not think that because the individual soul is a particle, it is fragmented from the whole spirit. Māyāvāda philosophy enunciates that the whole spirit exists, but a part of it, which is called the //jīva,// is entrapped by illusion. This philosophy, however, is unacceptable because spirit cannot be divided like a fragment of matter. That part, the //jīva,// is eternally a part. As long as the Supreme Spirit exists, His part and parcel also exists. As long as the sun exists, the molecules of the sun's rays also exist. The //jīva// particle is estimated in the Vedic literature to be one ten-thousandth the size of the upper portion of a hair. He is therefore infinitesimal. The Supreme Spirit is infinite, but the living entity, or individual soul, is infinitesimal, although he is not different in quality from the Supreme Spirit. Two words in this verse are to be particularly noted. One is //nirantaram,// which means \"nondifferent\" or \"of the same quality.\" The individual soul is also expressed here as //aṇimānam. Aṇimānam// means \"infinitesimal.\" The Supreme Spirit is all-pervading, but the very small spirit is the individual soul. //Akhaṇḍitam// means not exactly \"fragmented\" but \"constitutionally always infinitesimal.\" No one can separate the molecular parts of the sunshine from the sun, but at the same time the molecular part of the sunshine is not as expansive as the sun itself. Similarly, the living entity, by his constitutional position, is qualitatively the same as the Supreme Spirit, but he is infinitesimal. Self-realization means seeing one's proper identity as the infinitesimal //jīva.// At the present moment, we are seeing the body, but this is not our proper identity.

We are also //jyoti,// effulgent, like God, but God is //brahma-jyoti,// all-pervading and infinite.

The separation is only due to the wall of the pot. When the pot is broken, the inside and outside become one.

In this way we must understand the greatness of God and our own identity as minute particles. It is stated in the //purāṇas// that the individual soul is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of a hair. If we could somehow divide the tip of a hair into ten thousand parts, we might begin to understand how the soul is invisible. Self-realization means knowing our identity as small particles. The small particle of spirit soul is within every one of us, but it is not possible to see with material eyes. There is no instrument existing in the material universe by which one can actually //see// the soul. Because of our inability to perceive the soul, we say it is //nirākāra,// formless. We cannot even calculate its dimension (//ākāra//). Although we cannot calculate it, it is there nonetheless. The living entity has full form.

If someone claims to be God, he has to prove that no one is equal to him and that no one is greater. If he can do this, he is God. This is a very simple definition. //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.1) also verifies this statement: //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. The word //īśvara// means \"controller,\" and the word //parama// means \"supreme.\" We small living entities are controllers to a degree. We can control, at times, our family members, wives, children and so forth. Or we can control our office, factory, country or whatever. There are small controllers and larger controllers. If we go to Brahmā, we see that he is controlling the entire universe, but he is not the supreme controller. It is stated in the //śāstras// that Brahmā, the greatest living being within this universe, is also meditating in order to learn how to control. //Tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|(SB 1.1.1)]]. First of all, Brahmā learned to control the universe; then he became qualified as Brahmā. Although he was born Brahmā, he still had to be educated. If he was the first living being in the universe, who educated him? Kṛṣṇa.

The realization that one is the infinitesimal part and parcel of the Supreme Spirit makes one unattached to material, conditional life. That is the beginning of devotional service. Unless one is liberated from material contamination, one cannot engage in the devotional service of the Lord. In this verse, therefore, it is stated, //jñāna-vairāgya-yuktena:// when one is in full knowledge of one's constitutional position and is in the renounced order of life, detached from material attraction, then, by pure devotional service, //bhakti-yuktena,// he can engage himself as a loving servant of the Lord. //Paripaśyati// means that he can see everything in its right perspective.

Similarly, it is confirmed in the //Nārada-pañcarātra// that when the senses are purified, they can then be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord.

He is under the //daivī prakṛti,// the divine nature. There are two kinds of //prakṛti-parā prakṛti// and //aparā prakṛti.

As soon as one attains this knowledge, he reaches the //brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]] stage, Brahman realization, and he becomes //prasannātmā,// happy. One may ask, \"Why should I serve Kṛṣṇa?\" We have already explained that being a part means serving the whole. The whole is Kṛṣṇa, and the individuals are meant for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].// There are many //īśvaras,// controllers, but the supreme //īśvara// is Kṛṣṇa.

There are many //dharmas,// or activities. Some are pious and some impious, but Kṛṣṇa tells us to give up both. Arjuna was thinking that it was impious to fight with his relatives, but Kṛṣṇa was insisting that he fight. How could Arjuna act impiously? He could not, because Kṛṣṇa's service is transcendental to pious and impious activity. At midnight, when the //gopīs// heard the sound of Kṛṣṇa's flute, they ran to the forest to join Him. According to the //śāstras,// it is immoral for young girls to go see a young boy in a forest in the dead of night. But this was not an impious activity because the //gopīs// did this for Kṛṣṇa. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was so strict that no woman could even come near Him to offer respects, actually said: //ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā.// \"What could be more wonderful than that worship conceived by the //gopīs?//\" Although it actually appeared immoral for the //gopīs// to dance with Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu states that their relation with Kṛṣṇa is the highest form of worship. This is actually transcendental knowledge. One becomes transcendental to all pious and impious activities when one serves Kṛṣṇa. After all, piety and impiety are within the material modes. Kṛṣṇa's service is transcendental to good and bad, pious and impious. //Bhakti-yoga// begins when //jñāna// and //vairāgya// are complete. //Jñāna// is knowledge, and //vairāgya// is detachment from matter and engagement of the mind in spirit.

There are different kinds of //yogīs,// but every //yogī// is supposed to have attained self-realization, or Brahman realization.

Similarly, simply realizing that one is spirit soul is not sufficient. One has to engage in spiritual activity, and that spiritual activity is //bhakti.// Māyāvādī philosophers think that it is sufficient to stop all material activity, and the Buddhist philosophers advocate //nirvāṇa,// cessation of material life. Neither give more information. Actually we are suffering due to this material combination, and that is a fact. This body is composed of earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego. The Buddhists and Māyāvādīs advocate the annihilation of the components. They say, \"Let the earth go to earth, let the water go to water, let the fire go to fire and become zero.\" If we dismantle the house of the material body and become zero, we attain //nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa// means the cessation of pleasure and pain. The Māyāvādīs and Buddhists claim that if we fill an empty pitcher, the water will make some sound as long as the pitcher is not completely filled.

In other words, the Buddhists and Māyāvādīs claim that the material world is false, //mithyā,// and that we should somehow or other make it zero.

It is clearly stated here that when we simply purify the consciousness from material consciousness to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we attain liberation. Despite the statement that one should give up attachment, desirelessness is not possible for a living entity. A living entity, by constitution, has the propensity to be attached to something. We see that if someone has no object of attachment, if he has no children, he transfers his attachment to cats and dogs. This indicates that the propensity for attachment cannot be stopped; rather, it must be utilized for the best purpose. Our attachment for material things perpetuates our conditional state, but the same attachment, when transferred to the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His devotee, is the source of liberation. Here it is recommended that attachment should be transferred to the self-realized devotees, the //sādhus.// And who is a //sādhu?// A //sādhu// is not just an ordinary man with a saffron robe or long beard. A //sādhu// is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as one who unflinchingly engages in devotional service.

Atheists do not know that Kṛṣṇa's intelligence is always at least two inches greater than anyone else's. In material life, we simply struggle for existence. We want to exist, and we do not want to die. Nor do we want to undergo the pains of birth, catch diseases or grow old.

Someone may ill-treat him because the conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. They don't like it; that is their disease. The //sādhu// has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance of devotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, Haridāsa Ṭhākura was caned in twenty-two marketplaces, and Lord Caitanya's principal assistant, Nityānanda, was violently attacked by Jagāi and Mādhāi.

Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, who are always thinking of Kṛṣṇa within their minds and within their hearts, are not suffering as much because they know that whatever they might suffer is due to Kṛṣṇa's desire. Therefore they welcome suffering. For instance, when Kṛṣṇa was leaving, Queen Kuntī said, \"My dear Kṛṣṇa, when we were in a dangerous situation, You were always present as our friend and adviser. Now we are well situated with our kingdom, and now You are leaving for Dvārakā. This is not good. It is better that we again suffer so that we can always remember You.\" Thus the devotee sometimes welcomes suffering as an opportunity to remember Kṛṣṇa constantly. When a devotee suffers, he thinks, \"This is due to my past misdeeds. Actually I should be suffering a great deal, but due to Kṛṣṇa's grace I am suffering just a little. After all, suffering and enjoyment are in the mind.\" In this way, a devotee is not greatly affected by suffering, and this is the difference between a devotee and a nondevotee. Prahlāda Mahārāja, a five-year-old boy, had to undergo a great deal of suffering at the hands of his father, who was torturing him for being a devotee. The boy was trampled by elephants, thrown from a mountain, placed in burning oil and thrown into a snake pit, yet he was silent during this whole ordeal. Similarly, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, a Muhammadan by birth, was a very great devotee and was always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That was his only fault. However, the Muslim Kazi called him forth and said, \"You are a Muhammadan, born in a great Muhammadan family, yet you are chanting this Hindu Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// What is this?\" Haridāsa Ṭhākura mildly replied, \"My dear sir, there are many Hindus who have become Muhammadans. Suppose I have become a Hindu? What is wrong with this?\" The Kazi became very angry and ordered Haridāsa Ṭhākura to be whipped in twenty-two bazaars. This essentially meant that he was to be beaten to death, but because he was such a great devotee he did not actually feel the pain. Although a devotee may",

People are always putting a //sādhu// into difficulties, but he does not give up his job, which is to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that others may become happy. It was Prahlāda Mahārāja who said: \"My Lord, I am not suffering, for I know the art of being happy.\" How is this? \"Simply by hearing about You and chanting about You I am happy.\" This is the business of a devotee---hearing and chanting about the Lord. This is //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. Now this //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam// is taking place all over the world through the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Even in ordinary life it is possible for the mind to be absorbed in such a way that even a surgical operation may not disturb a man. Years ago, when Stalin had to undergo a surgical operation, he refused the use of chloroform. If this is possible even in an ordinary materialistic life, what to speak of spiritual life? One's mind should always be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in thinking of Kṛṣṇa. It is Kṛṣṇa's injunction, \"Always think of Me.\" The European and American youths in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement have been accustomed to many bad habits since birth, but now they have given these up. Many people think that it is impossible to live without illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. One famous Marquess told one of my Godbrothers, \"Please make me a //brāhmaṇa.//\" y Godbrother said, \"Yes, it is not a very difficult thing. Simply give up these bad habits---intoxication, illicit sex, meat-eating and gambling. Then you can become a //brāhmaṇa.//\" he Marquess then said, \"Impossible! This is our life.\" Actually we have seen that in Western countries older men cannot give up these habits, and because of this they are suffering, yet many young boys and girls have given them up, and there is no suffering. This is due to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This process is open to everyone. Everyone has heard of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// We can attain perfection simply by following the instructions given in this book.

This is called //ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// in the //Vedānta-sūtra.// The living entity and Kṛṣṇa are both //ānandamaya,// transcendentally blissful. On that platform, there is no possibility of material suffering. It is not a question of displaying some magical feats. The greatest magic is freedom from suffering, and this is the freedom of a devotee. When we feel pleasure from hearing about Kṛṣṇa and talking about Him, we should know that we are making progress on the path of perfection. At that time, material suffering will not be felt at all. This is the practical effect of rendering devotional service, which Lord Kapila is pointing out to His mother. ===== Text 24 ===== > ta ete sādhavaḥ sādhvi > sarva-saṅga-vivarjitāḥ > saṅgas teṣv atha te prārthyaḥ > saṅga-doṣa-harā hi te > [[books:sb:3:25:24|[SB 3.25.24]]] **O My mother, O virtuous lady, these are the qualities of great devotees who are free from all attachment.

The word //moha// used here means the false understanding that one is rich or poor.

Our consciousness at the present moment is polluted because of association with the three modes of nature; therefore in //Bhagavad-gītā// the same principle is stated. It is advised, //jita-saṅga-doṣāḥ:// one should be freed from the contaminated association of the three modes. Here also, in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// this is confirmed: a pure devotee, who is preparing to transfer himself to the spiritual kingdom, is also freed from the association of the three modes. We have to seek the association of such devotees. For this reason we have begun the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. There are many mercantile and scientific associations in human society established to develop a particular type of education or consciousness, but there is no association which helps one to get free from all material association. If anyone wishes to become free from this material contamination, he has to seek the association of devotees, wherein Kṛṣṇa consciousness is exclusively cultured. Because a devotee is freed from all contaminated material association, he is not affected by the miseries of material existence, even though he appears to be in the material world. How is it possible? A cat carries her kittens in her mouth, and when she kills a rat, she also carries the booty in her mouth. Thus both are carried in the mouth of the cat, but they are in different conditions. The kitten feels comfort in the mouth of the mother, whereas when the rat is carried in the mouth of the cat, the rat feels the blows of death. Similarly, those who are //sādhus,// or devotees engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, do not feel the contamination of material miseries, whereas those who are not devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness actually feel the miseries of material existence. One should therefore give up the association of materialistic persons and seek the association of those engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. By such association one will be benefited by spiritual advancement. By their words and instructions, one will be able to cut off his attachment to material existence. In this Kali-yuga, the present age, the dangerous modes of //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// passion and ignorance, are especially prominent. Practically everyone in this age is contaminated by lusty desire, greed and ignorance. It is said in the //śāstras// that in this",

Now Kapiladeva advises, \"Mother, if you want to get rid of the contamination of material nature, you should associate with a //sādhu.//\" ttachment to the material modes brings about our bondage. If we want to be free from this bondage, we have to transfer our attachment to a //sādhu.// Actually everyone is attached to something. No one can say that he is free from attachment. The Māyāvāda and Buddhist philosophies tell us to become detached, but this in itself is not possible. A child is attached to playing in so many ways, but gradually his attachments should be transferred to reading and going to school to acquire an education. It is a question not of stopping attachment but of transferring it. If one simply tries to put an end to attachment, he will become mad. Something must be given in the place of attachment. For instance, we tell our disciples to stop eating meat, but how is this meat-eating stopped? In the place of meat, we are supplying //kacaurīs, rasagullā// and many other palatable things. In this way, detachment is possible. First of all, nullify the inferior attachment, and then supply a better attachment. There is no question of forcing a living entity. This must be done gradually. A child may have some attachment, but by the system of replacing attachment, his attachment is overturned. Similarly, our consciousness has somehow or other become contaminated. Now it has to be purified. Then Kṛṣṇa consciousness will automatically arise and awaken. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is our original consciousness, but somehow or other it has become covered by material attachment. The question is how to give up material attachment and become attached to Kṛṣṇa.

This is a form of //bhakti.// Another vivid example is Arjuna, who was a fighter. By fighting, he became a devotee. He did not become a devotee by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa but by fighting in the Battle of Kurukṣetra. Kṛṣṇa advised him to fight, but because Arjuna was a Vaiṣṇava, in the beginning he was unwilling. A Vaiṣṇava does not like to kill anything, but if Kṛṣṇa orders him, he must fight. He does not fight out of his own will, because a Vaiṣṇava's natural instinct is not to do harm to anyone. However, when a Vaiṣṇava knows that Kṛṣṇa wants a particular thing done, he does not care for his own considerations. In any case, everyone has some particular type of duty, an occupation.

It is not that there are a million Gods. Of course, God can expand in millions of forms, but that is different.

The devotee who makes this association develops the consciousness for rendering service to the Lord, and then, being situated in the transcendental position of devotional service, he gradually becomes perfect. In all scriptures people are encouraged to act in a pious way so that they can enjoy sense gratification not only in this life but also in the next. For example, one is promised promotion to the heavenly kingdom of higher planets by pious fruitive activities. But a devotee in the association of devotees prefers to contemplate the activities of the Lord---how He has created this universe, how He is maintaining it, how the creation dissolves, and how in the spiritual kingdom the Lord's pastimes are enacted.

In addition, Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī in his //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// recommends that one should not hear //Bhagavad-gītā,// the //purāṇas,// the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// or any //hari-kathā// from anyone who is not a Vaiṣṇava in his actions. That means that we should not hear these Vedic literatures from the Māyāvādīs, who actually do not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can one not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord and yet dare to speak on //Bhagavad-gītā?// We will never derive any benefit from listening to the commentaries of such people. //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// should be heard from the devotees. We can hear //Bhagavad-gītā// from Māyāvādīs for hundreds of years and yet never understand Kṛṣṇa. It is therefore forbidden for Vaiṣṇavas to hear talks given by Māyāvādīs. //Hari-kathā,// talks about Śrī Hari, or Kṛṣṇa, are //amṛta,// nectar. If one hears them from the right source, he attains //amṛta (so 'mṛtatvāya kalpate). Mṛta// means \"birth and death,\" and //amṛta// means \"the cessation of birth and death.\" Spiritual life means putting an end to birth, old age, disease and death. Getting //amṛta,// nectar, means getting relief from birth and death, and that is the real aim of spiritual life. Lord Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:7:16|(7.16)]] that spiritual life begins when one is pious: > catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ > janāḥ sukṛtino 'rjuna > ārto jijñāsur arthārthī > jñānī ca bharatarṣabha \"O best among the Bhāratas [Arjuna], four kinds of pious men render devotional service unto Me---the distressed, the desirer of wealth, the inquisitive, and he who is searching for knowledge of the Absolute.\" If we actually want to become pious and develop our devotional life,",

Kṛṣṇa has instructed us to think of Him when drinking water. This is not very difficult. Kṛṣṇa also tells us to think of Him when we see sunlight in the morning. Why do we say, \"Can you show me God?\" God is showing us Himself. Why do we close our eyes to try to see Him? He says, \"I am this, and I am that.\" It is not that suddenly we can expect to see God, but we can become qualified to see God through the association of a //sādhu.// Presently many people are interested in receiving degrees from big universities, but education without God consciousness is simply an expansion of //māyā's// influence. Because knowledge is taken away by illusion, the universities are simply presenting impediments on the path of God consciousness.

Trying to become happy in this temporary, material life, the living entity has forgotten that he is the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa.

This requires a little training, and this training is given by the devotees. We should follow the devotees in their practical daily life, in their routine work and behavior.

It is said that pride precedes a fall. A Vaiṣṇava is by nature very humble. These are the chances one takes when one becomes a human being. Kṛṣṇa is personally advising us to take up the opportunities offered by the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We should take them and not run the risk of committing spiritual suicide. This is the process for understanding the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Person, the Supreme Being. In the Absolute, there are no contradictions. Kṛṣṇa's name, form, activities, paraphernalia and attributes are identical with Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of absolute. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's form and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's hands and Kṛṣṇa's legs are nondifferent. In the material world, there is a difference between our left hand and our right hand, between the nose and the ear, but these dualities do not exist in Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of absolute.

Why are we receiving different bodies? Because we have different tendencies for sense gratification. We actually have to come to detest sense gratification before our spiritual life begins. This is made possible through //bhakti.// Although Kṛṣṇa is beyond our vision, He has agreed to be seen by us through the //arcā-vigraha,// the Deity. We should not think that the Deity is made of stone. Even if it is stone, we should think that Kṛṣṇa has made Himself visible before us like a stone because we cannot see beyond stone. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Because our eyes and other senses are imperfect, we cannot see Kṛṣṇa present everywhere in His original spiritual form. Because we are imperfect, we see the difference between things spiritual and material, but Kṛṣṇa, being absolute, knows no such distinctions. He can become spiritual or material, however He likes, and it does not make any difference to Him. Being almighty and omnipotent, Kṛṣṇa can change matter into spirit and spirit into matter. Therefore we should not think, as the atheists do, that we are worshiping idols. Even if it is an idol, it is still Kṛṣṇa. That is the absolute nature of Kṛṣṇa. Even if we think that the Deity is a stone, or a piece of metal or some wood, He is still Kṛṣṇa. The understanding of this requires //bhakti// on our part. If we are a little thoughtful and philosophical, and if we are at all inclined toward //bhakti,// we can understand that Kṛṣṇa is present in stone. Actually, nothing is different from Kṛṣṇa because everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy. The Māyāvādī philosophers say that since everything is God, the personality of Kṛṣṇa is finished.

He sees Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's energy everywhere. For instance, if you love your child, when you see your child's shoe, you immediately see your child. Or if you see your child's toy, you immediately see your child and hear his voice. Similarly, if we have actually developed love of Kṛṣṇa, nothing exists but Kṛṣṇa. When our love for Kṛṣṇa is actually developed, whatever we see, we will see Kṛṣṇa. Unless one is advanced in //kṛṣṇa-premā,// love of Kṛṣṇa, he cannot see or understand. By the blunt material senses, we cannot even understand the name of Kṛṣṇa. People are always asking, \"Why are these people chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?\" They cannot understand, although Kṛṣṇa realization begins with the name. The name of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa are nondifferent, but we cannot realize this intellectually. We have to practice chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa to realize it. When we actually advance in devotional service and chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// offenselessly, we will realize that Kṛṣṇa and His name are nondifferent. Thus //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// begins with the tongue, for we can utilize the tongue to chant, and to taste //kṛṣṇa-prasāda.// In this way we can become a Kṛṣṇa //bhakta.// When we see the Deity of Kṛṣṇa in the temple, we should think that the Deity is Kṛṣṇa. In this way Kṛṣṇa has agreed to be seen by us and even dressed by us. However, if we think of Kṛṣṇa's //virāṭ-rūpa,// His universal form, what can we do? How can we dress the //virāṭ-rūpa?// His many heads cover the sky, and we cannot even conceive of Him. Kṛṣṇa can become bigger than the biggest and smaller than the smallest. Therefore this verse states: //bhaktyā pumāñ jāta-virāga aindriyāt.// The more we serve Kṛṣṇa, give Him things to eat and dress Him nicely, the less we become interested in our own bodies. In the material world everyone is very busy dressing himself very nicely in order to be sexually attractive, but if we try to dress Kṛṣṇa nicely, we will forget our own material dress. If we feed Kṛṣṇa nice food, we will forget to satisfy our own tongue by going to this or that restaurant.",

The last twelve years of His life were passed in madness. Sometimes He threw Himself into the ocean, and He wandered about like a madman. Of course, this is not possible for ordinary living entities.

Unless one has good engagements in spiritual service, it is not possible to become detached from material service. Those who are not devotees, therefore, are interested in so-called humanitarian or philanthropic work, such as opening a hospital or charitable institution. These are undoubtedly good works in the sense that they are pious activities, and the performer may get some opportunities for sense gratification, either in this life or in the next. Devotional service, however, is beyond the boundary of sense gratification. It is a completely spiritual activity. When one engages in the spiritual activities of devotional service, he does not engage in sense gratificatory activities. Kṛṣṇa conscious activities are performed not blindly but with the perfect understanding of knowledge and renunciation. This kind of //yoga// practice, in which the mind is always fixed upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead in devotion, results in liberation in this very life. The person who performs such acts gets in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Caitanya, therefore, approved the process of hearing from realized devotees about the pastimes of the Lord. It does not matter to what mundane category the audience belongs. If one meekly and submissively hears about the activities of the Lord from a realized soul, he will be able to conquer the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is unconquerable by any other process.

Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura therefore says, //yasya prasādād,// by the mercy of the spiritual master, the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //bhagavat-prasādaḥ,// is revealed. Devahūti requested her great son to be merciful toward her because she was a less intelligent woman and also His mother. By the grace of Kapiladeva it was quite possible for her to understand the Absolute Truth, even though the subject matter is very difficult for ordinary persons, especially women. In this verse Devahūti shows us the process for understanding transcendental subject matters. It is not by challenge but by submission. The entire //bhakti// process is a process of submission. That is also Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching: > tṛṇād api sunīcena > taror iva sahiṣṇunā > amāninā mānadena > kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ > [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]] If one is interested in advancing in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu advises that one be humbler than the grass and more tolerant than the trees. One should not be very proud of his intelligence but should give all respect to others. In this way, one can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa offenselessly. Although Devahūti was the mother of Kapiladeva, she presented herself as a humble woman. It was not that she considered herself superior because she was His mother. We have to please the spiritual master by service, and the entire //bhakti// process depends on the attitude of service. The transcendental nature of Kṛṣṇa is not possible to understand with our blunt material senses. Kṛṣṇa's name, form, qualities and pastimes are all //divya,// divine.

He is within everyone, and He can understand whether one is sincere or not. Kṛṣṇa helps a sincere devotee internally and externally. Internally He helps as paramātmā by giving intelligence from within. //Dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam.// Externally He helps as His representative, the spiritual master. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says: //guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja. \"By// the grace of Kṛṣṇa, one gets a bona fide //guru,// and by the grace of the //guru,// one gets Kṛṣṇa.\" [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|(Cc.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said that this method is not very practical. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has been called by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī \"the most munificent //avatāra//\" because He distributes love of Kṛṣṇa free of charge. First of all, we cannot even understand Kṛṣṇa; therefore there is no question of loving Him. If we do not understand someone, how can we love him? The love is very far away, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so kind that He distributes //kṛṣṇa-premā,// love of Kṛṣṇa, to whomever will take it. In His life, Caitanya Mahāprabhu cried for Kṛṣṇa and showed how one should be mad after Him. > yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa > cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam > śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ > govinda-viraheṇa me \"O Govinda!

This is Rādhārāṇī's frame of mind, but this is not possible for an ordinary living being. It was possible for Caitanya Mahāprabhu and a few devotees, His immediate disciples like the six Gosvāmīs, who were following in His footsteps.

We should not try to understand Kṛṣṇa by our small knowledge. Since we are imperfect, how can we speculate on Kṛṣṇa?

One has to receive the mercy of Kṛṣṇa through the spiritual master, and this is the path recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Sthāne-sthitāḥ śruti-gatāḥ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ// (SB 10.14.3). Another name for Kṛṣṇa is Ajita. No one can conquer Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa can be conquered by His devotee. One should be submissive and say, \"Kṛṣṇa, I am very poor. I have no means to understand You.

There are different methods of self-realization. But here Devahūti especially refers to the //bhakti-yoga// system, which has already been primarily explained by the Lord. The different processes of the //bhakti-yoga// system are hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping the Lord in the temple, accepting service to Him, carrying out His orders, making friends with Him and ultimately surrendering everything for His service. The word //nirvāṇātman// is very significant in this verse. Unless one accepts the process of devotional service, one cannot end the continuation of material existence. As far as //jñānīs// are concerned, they are interested in //jñāna-yoga,// but even if one elevates oneself, after a great performance of austerity, to the Brahman effulgence, there is a chance of falling down again to the material world. Therefore, //jñāna-yoga// does not actually end material existence. Similarly, regarding the //haṭha-yoga// system, which aims at the localized aspect of the Lord, Paramātmā, it has been experienced that many //yogīs,// such as Viśvāmitra, fall down. But //bhakti-yogīs,// once approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead, never come back to this material world, as confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā.

The soul is ever-existing. Therefore //nirvāṇa// means to end one's material existence, and to end material existence means to go back home, back to Godhead. Sometimes it is asked how the living entity falls down from the spiritual world to the material world. Here is the answer. Unless one is elevated to the Vaikuṇṭha planets and is directly in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is prone to fall down, either from the impersonal Brahman realization or from an ecstatic trance of meditation. Another word in this verse, //bhagavad-bāṇaḥ,// is very significant. //Bāṇaḥ// means \"arrow.\" The //bhakti-yoga// system is just like an arrow aiming up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

We must understand the Supreme Person, //tattvataḥ,// in truth. Generally people are not interested in knowing about God or their relationship with Him. However, the entire Vedic instruction is for this purpose. First of all we have to know God, then we have to know our relationship with God. The next step is acting on the basis of that relationship. Kṛṣṇa states that out of many millions of people, one may be interested in knowing the purpose of life. Human life is meant for this end, and if one does not come to this understanding, he is no better than an animal. We not only have to understand God and our relationship with Him but also how to act in that relationship. In this way we can perfect our lives. When one is a //siddha,// one understands himself---that is, one understands, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// \"I am not this body.\" This is Brahman realization, the //brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]] platform.

The shores of the ocean are set; they have certain limits. However, the ocean of bliss is constantly increasing. The more we enter into that spiritual bliss, the more we become joyful.

It is not possible to chant a material name for very long because the chanting would become hackneyed and very tiresome.

He said, \"How is it that this Kṛṣṇa, this boy of Vṛndāvana, is being worshiped? He is called the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How is that?\" Lord Indra was also bewildered. Therefore if we do not wish to be bewildered we have to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth from Kṛṣṇa Himself or His bona fide representative. The activities of Kṛṣṇa are not ordinary but divine. If we can understand this, we immediately become liberated. We need only understand the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the //gopīs.// These pastimes are not ordinary.

Therefore we have to learn from the proper person about Kṛṣṇa's activities. We should not immediately try to understand Kṛṣṇa's dealings with the //gopīs,// for they are very confidential. These dealings are given in the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and this indicates that we have to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is by first reading the preceding nine cantos.

Actually //bhakti// should be automatic and spontaneous. There should be no motive in serving Kṛṣṇa, but even if there is a motive, service rendered unto Kṛṣṇa is good. Even if one approaches Kṛṣṇa with some ulterior motive, one is considered pious. For instance, Dhruva Mahārāja initially worshiped Kṛṣṇa with a motive, but after attaining perfection in devotional service, his ulterior motive vanished. When he actually saw Kṛṣṇa, he said, \"I do not want anything from You. I don't want any benediction other than Your service.\" After hearing about the many transcendental qualities of Kṛṣṇa, if we somehow or other become attracted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, our lives will be successful. //Tasmāt kenāpy upāyena manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet:// \"Somehow or other we have to attach our minds to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.\" [[books:sb:7:1:32|(SB 7.1.32)]] Then Kṛṣṇa will help us and give us intelligence from within, as He indicates in //Bhagavad-gītā// ( 10.10): > teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ > bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam > dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ > yena mām upayānti te \"To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.\" This is actual //buddhi-yoga.

The devotional service most suitable for different types of devotees is determined and fixed by the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore in order to become free from the miseries of material nature, one should approach a bona fide spiritual master inquisitively and submissively. When Arjuna submitted to Kṛṣṇa, he said, \"My dear Kṛṣṇa, now I no longer care to talk to You as a friend because friendly talks will not benefit me now.\" Generally we talk to a friend just to spend time, but when we approach a spiritual master, we should be submissive. Friends approach one another on an equal basis, but this is not the way to approach a spiritual master. Unless one is submissive, one cannot accept sublime instructions. Arjuna teaches us submission by giving up his friendly relationship with Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He says, \"I have now become Your disciple.

It is not that one should accept just any person as a //guru.// The //guru// must be the representative of Kṛṣṇa; then one can surrender oneself.

Arjuna was lamenting for the body, thinking that it was horrible that his relatives would be killed in war. This was not the proper subject matter for him to be contemplating. The real subject matter for a wise man to contemplate is the salvation of the soul. Therefore Śrī Kṛṣṇa first explained the distinction between the body and the soul. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is also concerned with the soul, and therefore we have used the word \"consciousness\" because consciousness belongs to the soul. Consciousness is the symptom of the soul's presence. Because the soul is in the body, the body feels pleasure and pain. When the soul leaves the body, the body can be hacked to pieces, and yet it will not protest. This is because the consciousness is gone.

The //sāṅkhya-yoga// explained by Lord Kapiladeva, the son of Devahūti, is practically unknown in the West. The //sāṅkhya-yoga// propounded herein is actually //bhakti.// It is stated here that the proper way to receive this knowledge is by disciplic succession, not by philosophical speculation.

He would not need ordinary soldiers. Duryodhana, on the other hand, decided to take Kṛṣṇa's soldiers. Thus in order to pacify Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa told him not to worry, although he could not execute the //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system. \"The first-class //yogī// is he who always thinks of Me.\" One should always remember that Kṛṣṇa is within his heart and think of Him. This is the proper system of meditation. If we always chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// we will always remember Kṛṣṇa, and immediately the form of Kṛṣṇa will be awakened within our hearts. The process of always thinking of Kṛṣṇa is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The first-class //yogī// is he who is always conscious of Kṛṣṇa. One can be conscious of Kṛṣṇa by hearing about Him submissively. We have to accept Kṛṣṇa through the disciplic succession. There are four //sampradāyas,// disciplic successions. One comes from Lord Brahmā (the Brahma-sampradāya), and another comes from Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, (the Śrī-sampradāya). There are also the Kumāra-sampradāya and the Rudra-sampradāya. At the present moment, the Brahmā sampradāya is represented by the Madhva-sampradāya, and we belong to the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. Our original //sampradāya// stems from Madhvācārya. In that //sampradāya// there was Mādhavendra Purī, and Mādhavendra Purī's disciple was Śrī Īśvara Purī. Śrī Īśvara Purī's disciple was Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Thus we are coming in the disciplic succession from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and therefore our //sampradāya// is called the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya.

Since he was not born of a father and mother, he is therefore called Svayambhū. Nārada Muni is also a //mahājana,// and Śambhu is Lord Śiva. Kumāra refers to the four Kumāras---Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanātana and Sanat-kumāra. There are twelve authorities following the Sāṅkhya philosophy, or //bhakti-yoga,// and these include Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Kapiladeva, Manu, Bhīṣmadeva, Janaka Mahārāja, Śukadeva Gosvāmī and prahlāda Mahārāja.

There is another story, about an old woman who was carrying a bundle of dry wood through the forest. Somehow or other the bundle, which was very heavy, fell to the ground. The old woman became very disturbed, and thought, \"Who will help put this bundle back on my head?\" She then began to call on God, saying, \"God help me.\" Suddenly God appeared and said, \"What do you want?\" She said, \"please help me put this bundle back on my head.\" So this is our foolishness.

Harā is Kṛṣṇa's internal potency, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī or Lakṣmī. //Jaya rādhe!// This is //daivī prakṛti,// and the devotees take shelter of the //daivī prakṛti,// Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Thus the Vaiṣṇavas worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa and Sītā-Rāma. In the beginning of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// we first address the internal energy of Kṛṣṇa, Hare. Thus we say, \"O Rādhārāṇī! O Hare! O energy of the Lord!\" When we address someone in this way, he usually says, \"Yes, what do you want?\" The answer is, \"Please engage me in Your service.\" This should be our prayer. We should not say, \"O energy of the Lord, O Kṛṣṇa, please give me money. Please give me a beautiful wife. Please give me many followers. Please give me some prestigious position. Please give me the presidency.\" These are all material hankerings, which should be avoided. Lord Buddha advocated that we give up all material desires. It is not possible to become desireless, but it is possible to give up material desires. It is the nature of the living entity to desire; it is not possible to be desireless. If one is desireless, he is dead. Desirelessness means purifying one's desire, and desire is purified when we only desire the service of Kṛṣṇa.

Śaṅkarācārya gives a little more, saying that we should become desireless in this material world and then enter into the Brahman effulgence. This is called //brahma-nirvāṇa.// According to the Vaiṣṇava philosophy, however, we should negate material desires and be situated on the Brahman platform, but in addition we should engage in the devotional service of the Lord. This is called //bhakti.// Māyāvādī philosophers cannot understand this, but Kṛṣṇa says that this devotional service is on the transcendental platform. The Sāṅkhya philosophy of the atheist Kapila, which is a material philosophy, is simply the study of the twenty-four elements. However, the real Sāṅkhya philosophy, propounded by Kapiladeva, is transcendental to the twenty-four elements and material activity. Thus in this Sāṅkhya philosophy, which is actually //bhakti-yoga,// there is no desire for material benefits. On the material platform, a person works for his own personal sense gratification or for some expanded sense gratification. One may work for himself, family, wife, children, society, community, nation or humanity at large. This is simply expanded sense gratification. Whether one steals for himself, family, community or whatever, the fact remains that he is a thief. It is said that when Alexander the Great arrested a common thief, the thief told Alexander, \"What is the difference between us? I am a small plunderer, and you are a great plunderer.\" Being very sensible, Alexander released him, saying, \"Yes, there is no difference.\" Regardless whether the sense gratification is for oneself, one's family, one's nation or whatever, it is, after all, sense gratification. The quality changes only when we work for the sense gratification of Kṛṣṇa. It is noteworthy that //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// never states that //kṛṣṇa uvāca// (\"Kṛṣṇa says\") or //kapiladeva uvāca// (\"Kapiladeva says\"). Rather, it states //bhagavān uvāca// (\"the Supreme Personality of Godhead says\"). This means that the version is perfect. If we receive knowledge from an ordinary man, there will be many defects. An ordinary person is subject to illusion, and he also has the tendency to cheat. Although an ordinary person may be a very advanced scholar, he does not possess perfect knowledge.

We are not presenting anything that we ourselves could manufacture. Whatever we manufacture is sure to be defective or deficient. What is the value of my philosophy? What is the value of my thought? Generally, people say, \"In my opinion,\" thinking that \"my opinion\" really means something. People do not think, \"I am simply a rascal.\" People value their opinion, thinking it something very big. Everyone in this material world has imperfect senses; therefore whatever knowledge has been gathered through the senses is necessarily imperfect.

If the digestive power is sufficient, then whatever we eat will be digested by the fire in the stomach. Similarly, a devotee doesn't have to try separately to attain liberation. That very service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the process of liberation because to engage in the service of the Lord is to liberate oneself from material entanglement. For a devotee, liberation is no problem at all. Liberation takes place without separate endeavor. //Bhakti,// therefore, is far better than //mukti// or the impersonalist position.

Animals think, \"This is my dog friend, and this is my mother dog.\" They cannot see beyond the gross body. Similarly, we cannot see the soul, and if we cannot see the minute soul, how can we hope to see God with these blunt eyes? We cannot actually see one another. How, then, can we hope to see God?

A pure devotee, as Kapila Muni will explain, does not aspire for any of the liberations. He especially despises the attempt to become one with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

That is the theory put forward by Māyāvāda philosophy. Actually the impersonalists do not merge into the existence of the Supreme person but into His personal bodily luster, which is called //brahmajyoti.// Although that //brahmajyoti// is not different from His personal body, that sort of oneness (merging into the bodily luster of the Personality of Godhead) is not accepted by a pure devotee because the devotees engage in greater pleasure than merging into His existence.

You are supremely powerful, and whatever I get, I get from You. I was born into a family of demons and was inclined toward material enjoyment.

According to their own theory, everything is God. Then why is the Deity not God? Actually, they have no conception of God. The devotees' vision, however, is different; their vision is smeared with love of God. As soon as they see the Lord in His different forms, the devotees become saturated with love, for they do not find any difference between the Lord and His form in the temple, as do the atheists. The smiling face of the Deity in the temple is beheld by the devotees as transcendental and spiritual, and the decorations on the body of the Lord are very much appreciated by the devotees. It is the duty of the spiritual master to teach his devotees how to decorate the Deity in the temple, how to cleanse the temple and how to worship the Deity. There are different procedures, rules and regulations followed in temples of Viṣṇu, and devotees go there and see the Deity, the //vigraha,// and spiritually enjoy the form, because all of the Deities are benevolent. The devotees express their minds before the Deity, and in many instances the Deity also gives answers. But one must be a very elevated devotee in order to be able to speak with the Supreme Lord. Sometimes the Lord informs the devotee through dreams. These exchanges between the Deity and the devotee are not understandable by atheists, but actually the devotee enjoys them. Clearly, those who have the eyes to see Kṛṣṇa will see Him. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the temple of Jagannātha, He immediately fainted upon seeing the Deity. He said, \"Oh, here is My Lord!

It is not that we can immediately talk to presidents or even to senators just because we want to talk to them. Somehow or other we must comply with certain rules and regulations. Kṛṣṇa is ready to talk to us, and for this purpose He has descended in the //arcā-mūrti,// the Deity, in order to be seen. We simply have to qualify ourselves to talk with Him. The nondevotees, Māyāvādīs, who are interested in denying Kṛṣṇa, say that God has no eyes, no legs, no hands, no ears and so on. This is indirectly saying that God is blind and deaf and that He cannot do this or that. In this way, they are indirectly insulting God. This is blasphemy. God does not want to hear such nonsense. Therefore it is said in this verse: //sākaṁ vācaṁ spṛhaṇīyāṁ vadanti.// By saying that Kṛṣṇa is blind, that He has no eyes, no hands, no nothing, we are indirectly saying that Kṛṣṇa does not exist. This is certainly not a favorable way to talk about Kṛṣṇa. If we want to talk about Kṛṣṇa, we must consult the Vedic literatures. Then we can understand how Kṛṣṇa should be worshiped.

He wears a peacock feather in His hair, and His form is very beautiful.\" The Māyāvādīs say, \"Just imagine some form of God.\" But God's form cannot be imagined.

It is the nature of demons to give devotees trouble, just as in the West, Lord Jesus Christ was crucified because he was preaching God consciousness. Similarly, Hiraṇyakaśipu tried to kill his five-year-old boy Prahlāda Mahārāja because his son was talking about Kṛṣṇa. There were many demons who tried to kill Kṛṣṇa Himself, great demons like Pūtanā, Aghāsura, Bakāsura and Kaṁsa. Nonetheless, Kṛṣṇa destroys them all by His omnipotence.

Even the third-class devotees are liberated souls. It is explained in this verse that although they do not have knowledge, simply by seeing the beautiful decoration of the Deity in the temple, they are absorbed in thought of Him and lose all other consciousness. By fixing oneself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, engaging the senses in the service of the Lord, one is imperceptibly liberated. This is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā.// Simply by discharging uncontaminated devotional service as prescribed in the scriptures, one becomes equal to Brahman. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. This means that the living entity in his original state is Brahman because he is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman. Because of his forgetfulness of his real nature as an eternal servitor of the Lord, he is overwhelmed and captured by //māyā.// His forgetfulness of his real constitutional position is //māyā.// Otherwise he is eternally Brahman. When one is trained to become conscious of his position, he understands that he is the servitor of the Lord. \"Brahman\" refers to a state of self-realization.

In other words, it is confirmed herein that even a third-class devotee is in the transcendental position, above those who are striving for liberation by speculation or other methods.

Even though they were in the liberated state, instead of remaining impersonalists they were attracted by the beauty of the Lord and became devotees. Here the word //vilāsa// is very important. //Vilāsa// refers to the activities or pastimes of the Lord. It is a prescribed duty in temple worship that not only should one visit the temple to see the Deity nicely decorated, but at the same time he should hear the recitation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā// or some similar literature, which is regularly recited in the temple. In Vṛndāvana, in every temple, there is recitation of the //śāstras.// Even third-class devotees who have no literary knowledge or no time to read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// or //Bhagavad-gītā// have the opportunity to hear about the pastimes of the Lord. In this way their minds may remain always absorbed in the thought of the Lord---His form, His activities and His transcendental nature. This state of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a liberated stage. Lord Caitanya, therefore, recommended five important processes in the discharge of devotional service: (1) to chant the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, (2) to associate with devotees and serve them as far as possible, (3) to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// (4) to see the decorated temple and the Deity and, if possible, (5) to live in a place like Vṛndāvana or Mathurā. These five items alone can help a devotee achieve the highest perfectional stage. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// and in this verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That third-class devotees can also imperceptibly achieve liberation is accepted in all Vedic literatures.

Thus we should practice observing the Supreme Lord, and to this end He has appeared before us as the //arcā-vigraha.// There are three kinds of devotee: //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī// and //uttama-adhikārī.// The //uttama-adhikārī// is the most advanced; the //madhyama-adhikārī// is in the middle stage; and the //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī// is the neophyte. It is recommended that the neophyte meditate on the Deity daily. He should begin by meditating on the lotus feet, and then when he is practiced, he should turn his gaze toward Kṛṣṇa's smiling face. The neophyte should also read and hear //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// If we simply try to see and don't listen, the results will not be permanent. In some temples there are Deities but no discussion about Kṛṣṇa. People attend for some time, but after a while they lose interest. Thus there must be two activities. The Deities must be worshiped, and this is called //pāñcarātrikī-vidhi.// There must also be //bhāgavata-vidhi,// reading //Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Pāñcarātrikī-vidhi// and //bhāgavata-vidhi// go hand in hand. By participating in these two processes, the neophyte can gradually attain the intermediate stage. The spiritual master is supposed to be in the most advanced stage, but for preaching purposes he descends to the intermediate stage. The //uttama-adhikārī,// the most advanced devotee, does not discriminate between devotees and nondevotees. He sees everyone but himself as a devotee. The truly advanced devotee sees that he is not a devotee but that everyone else is a devotee.

He can also understand that this man is innocent and that this man is not. The innocent do not know what is to be done, and they do not know anything about God. They are not actually offenders, but there are others who are offenders. The offenders become immediately envious as soon as they hear about God or His devotees. The //madhyama-adhikārī// knows that Kṛṣṇa is God: //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. He wants to develop his love for Kṛṣṇa. He also wants to see that not a moment is wasted without engagement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is always careful not to spoil life's valuable time. That is the first qualification of a //madhyama-adhikārī.// We have a very short period to live, and we never know when we are going to die. There is no certainty. Foolish people think that they will go on living forever, but that is simply foolishness. Life is transient; therefore the devotee wants to utilize every moment for the advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Faith is explained by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī thus: > 'śraddhā'-śabde-viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya > kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya \"By rendering transcendental loving service to Kṛṣṇa, one automatically performs all subsidiary activities. This confident, firm faith, favorable to the discharge of devotional service, is called //śraddhā.//\"(Cc. Madhya 22.62) In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa says that He is not only a person but the Supreme Personality of Godhead as well. He also says that there is no one superior to Him. If one believes these words, then one will have faith. Impersonalists read //Bhagavad-gītā,// but they do not accept Kṛṣṇa as a person. In the Twelfth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa says that the impersonalist takes more trouble to come to Him. He will come later, but it will take some time. This is because impersonal understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth is partial understanding. As Kṛṣṇa states: > kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām > avyaktāsakta-cetasām > avyaktā hi gatir duḥkhaṁ > dehavadbhir avāpyate \"For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome. To make progress in that discipline is always difficult for those who are embodied.\" [[books:bg:12:5|(Bg. 12.5)]] We have often given the example of impersonal understanding being like the understanding of the sunshine. One may see the sunshine entering through a window into his room, but this does not mean that one knows everything about the sun. Impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth is like that. The sunshine is impersonal (Brahman), the sun itself is localized (Paramātmā) and the sun-god residing within the sun is a person (Bhagavān). Just as one can understand the three aspects of the sun---the sunshine, the sun itself and the sun-god---one can also understand the three aspects of the Supreme Absolute Truth---Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān.

We live on this planet, which is basically composed of earth, and our bodies are basically composed of earth in order to live here. Bodies are made in such a way that they can live in their environment. Similarly, the sun-god has a body capable of living in fire. Kṛṣṇa is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], being, knowledge and bliss, with form. Impersonal understanding is understanding of the //sat// feature. Understanding Kṛṣṇa in full is understanding all of His features. The //ānanda// feature is realized in Bhagavān. Kṛṣṇa plays on His flute and is accompanied by His pleasure potency, //hlādinī śakti,// Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Of Kṛṣṇa's many potencies, the //hlādinī śakti// is His pleasure-giving potency. That is //ānanda.// Although Kṛṣṇa is full in Himself, He expands Himself when He wants to enjoy. That expansion is His pleasure potency, Rādhārāṇī.

If one's mind and senses are completely absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one is experiencing //bhakti. Bhakti// is not a sentiment but a practical science. One may engage in many activities, but in all cases, one's mind must be fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa. Although a housewife is always busy working around the house, she always takes care that her hair is nicely combed. Regardless of her engagements, she never forgets to arrange her hair in an attractive way. Similarly, a devotee engages in many activities, but he never forgets Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form. This is the meaning of perfection.",

We experience different varieties of material enjoyment even on this planet, but if one is able to promote himself to higher planets like Candraloka, the sun or, still higher, Maharloka, Janaloka and Tapoloka, or even ultimately the highest planet, which is inhabited by Brahmā and is called Satyaloka, one will find immense possibilities for material enjoyment. For example, the duration of life on higher planets is far, far greater than on this planet. It is said that on the moon the duration of life is such that our six months are equal to one day. We cannot even imagine the duration of life on the highest planet. It is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// that Brahmā's twelve hours are inconceivable even to our mathematicians. These are all descriptions of the external energy of the Lord, or //māyā.// Besides these, there are other opulences which the //yogīs// can achieve by their mystic power. They are also material. A devotee does not aspire for all these material pleasures, although they are available to him simply by wishing. By the grace of the Lord, a devotee can achieve wonderful material success simply by willing, but a real devotee does not do so. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught that one should not desire material opulence or material reputation, nor should one try to enjoy material beauty; he should only aspire to be absorbed in the devotional service of the Lord, even if he does not get liberation but has to continue the process of birth and death unlimitedly. Actually, however, to one who engages in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, liberation is already guaranteed. Devotees enjoy all the benefits of the higher planets and the Vaikuṇṭha",

But still he gets that advantage; he enjoys all the facilities of the material and spiritual worlds, even during the present life span. According to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Rūpa Gosvāmī in his //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// Nārada Muni in the //Nārada-pañcarātra// and Bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā,// a pure devotee never wants anything from the Lord. He does not even want liberation, to say nothing of material things. Generally, people want //dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa,// in that order. First of all, people want to become religious (//dharma//) in order to attain material opulence (//artha//). People want material opulence in order to gratify their senses (//kāma//), and when they are frustrated in their attempt to gratify their senses, they want liberation (//mokṣa//). In this way, //dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa// are going on. However, a devotee is not interested in any of these. In the Christian religion, people pray, \"Give us this day our daily bread,\" but a pure //bhakta// does not even ask for his daily bread. A pure devotee is kept in the hand of Kṛṣṇa just like a very precious jewel. When you hold something precious in your hand, you are very careful, and similarly, Kṛṣṇa holds the devotee and takes care of him. One can just imagine his position if a very rich man says, \"Don't worry. I will take care of everything for you.\" Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is the proprietor of all opulence. There is no one more opulent than Kṛṣṇa; therefore if Kṛṣṇa says that He will take care of His devotee, there is no question of poverty. Most people want material opulence, but they do not know that Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor of all opulence. That is their misfortune. Although the proprietor of all opulence says, \"Just surrender unto Me, and I will take care of you,\" people do not do it. Instead, they say, \"I will take care of my own business. I will maintain myself. I will take care of myself, my family, my friends and my country.\" Arjuna was very intelligent because he simply chose Kṛṣṇa, whereas Duryodhana took Kṛṣṇa's soldiers.

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu tells us to abandon speculating about God.

Is it bigger than this well? Is it four feet? Ten feet?\" Our attempt to speculate about God is very much like this. If we want to understand God, we have to try to understand from God Himself. We may have a neighbor who is very wealthy, influential, wise, strong and beautiful, and we may speculate about his opulence, but if we make friends with him, we can understand his position by listening to him speak about himself. God cannot be subjected to our imagination. Our imagination is limited, and our senses are imperfect. The process of //bhakti-mārga// is the process of submission. There is no question of subjecting God to our imagination. We simply have to become very humble and submissive and pray to Kṛṣṇa sincerely, \"Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me to know You. Kindly explain how it is I can know You, and then it will be possible.\" This is the way Arjuna approached Kṛṣṇa in the Eleventh Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā.// We can hardly understand or comprehend the innumerable universes. The word //jagat// refers to this universe, but there is more than one universe. Although we are seeing only one universe, there are millions of universes, and Kṛṣṇa is supporting all these millions of universes with a single fragment of Himself.

Formerly there were no presses to print these literatures, and these important Vedic writings were written by hand. These literatures were not very cheap, and only highly qualified //brāhmaṇas// were able to keep them. They were worshiped in the temple as the //śāstra// Deity. It is not that they were available everywhere. Now, of course, the printing press has changed all this, but nonetheless we should always understand that the //granthas,// the scriptures, should be worshiped as God because they are the sound incarnation of God. One should not consider //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to be ordinary books, and one should take care of them just as carefully as one takes care of the Deity. At any rate, when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu returned from South India with a copy of //Brahma-saṁhitā,// He gave it to His disciples and told them that it was a summary of the //Vedānta// and the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// We therefore accept //Brahma-saṁhitā// as authorized scripture, for it was authorized by the Supreme Person, Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

It is stated that from the skin pores of the Mahā-Viṣṇu, all the universes are emanating. In each universe there is a Brahmā, a supervisor, who is the supreme creature and manager. These managers live only as long as the Mahā-Viṣṇu exhales. When He exhales, all the universes are created, and when He inhales, they all return into His body. In this way so many universes and Brahmās are coming and going. The durations of these breaths, which constitute a life of a Brahmā, are described in //Bhagavad-gītā// as many trillions of earth years. One may say that this is all fictitious and imaginary, but unless one believes it, one has no right to touch //Bhagavad-gītā.// Generally people are interested in going to the higher planetary systems in order to become more opulent.

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:8:16|(8.16)]] Śrī Kṛṣṇa says, //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna:// \"From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place.\" Even if we are promoted to the highest planet, Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahmā lives, our situation there is still not eternal. So why should a devotee be interested in such a place? A devotee is simply interested in the supreme eternal, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The Supreme Lord is the supreme leader of the //nityas,// the eternal living entities. We are all //nityas,// eternal, and Kṛṣṇa guides and plays with us. In the spiritual world, Kṛṣṇa and His devotees are friends, and they play together as cowherd boys. They are not interested in Brahmaloka or Candraloka, for these planets will ultimately be annihilated. There are some living entities that live only a few seconds, or, at most, a night. By the morning, they are all dead. Any life in the material world is comparable to that. Brahmā may live millions of years, but he ultimately has to die. Whether we go to the highest planet or the lowest planet, whether we are in the body of a Brahmā or a cat, we ultimately have to die. Kṛṣṇa presents Himself to atheists as death. He appeared in this way before Hiraṇyakaśipu, who said, \"I am God. All the demigods are afraid of me. I am very powerful.\" Kṛṣṇa comes before such atheists as death and takes everything away---all power, opulence, money---everything. The theists worship God while they are living, and their only business in this life is serving God. After death, they render the same service; thus there is no difference between Vaikuṇṭha and a temple, for a devotee. In either case, his business is the same. Why, then, should he aspire to go to Vaikuṇṭha? In the Vaikuṇṭha planets one attains opulence like Kṛṣṇa or Nārāyaṇa. There are five kinds of //mukti,// liberation, and one is //sārṣṭi.// This kind of liberation brings one opulence equal to the Lord. In the Vaikuṇṭha planets, everyone is four-handed like Nārāyaṇa, and everyone is equally opulent. In Goloka",

In this way, they get everything. Nor are the devotees interested in attaining the mystic //yoga siddhis.// They do not need to be able to create a planet, for they can create Vaikuṇṭha by worshiping Kṛṣṇa in the temple.

But as far as the devotees are concerned, their assets---the achievement of devotional service and the consequent opulence of Vaikuṇṭha, even on this planet---are never destroyed. In this verse Kapiladeva addresses His mother as //śānta-rūpa,// indicating that the opulences of devotees are fixed because devotees are eternally fixed in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere, which is called //śānta-rūpa// because it is in the mode of pure goodness, undisturbed by the modes of passion and ignorance. Once one is fixed in the devotional service of the Lord, his position of transcendental service cannot be destroyed, and the pleasure and service simply increase unlimitedly. For the devotees engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere, there is no influence of time. In the material world the influence of time destroys everything, but in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere there is no influence of time or of the demigods because there are no demigods in the Vaikuṇṭha planets. Here our activities are controlled by different demigods; even if we move our hand and leg, the action is controlled by the demigods. But in the Vaikuṇṭha atmosphere there is no influence of the demigods or of time; therefore there is no question of destruction. When the time element is present, there is the certainty of destruction, but when there is no time element---past, present or future---then everything is eternal. Therefore this verse uses the words //naṅkṣyanti no,// indicating that the transcendental opulences will never be destroyed. The reason for freedom from destruction is also described. The devotees accept the Supreme Lord as the most dear personality and reciprocate with Him in different relationships. They accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead as a dearmost friend, relative, son, preceptor, well-wisher or Deity. The Lord is eternal; therefore any relationship in which we accept Him is also eternal. It is clearly confirmed herein that the relationships cannot be destroyed, and therefore the opulences of those relationships are never destroyed.

We shall eternally enjoy the relationship with the Supreme Lord in different aspects. A special feature of this verse is the acceptance of the Supreme Lord as the supreme preceptor. //Bhagavad-gītā// is spoken directly by the Supreme Lord, and Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as his //guru,// or spiritual master. Similarly, we should accept only Kṛṣṇa as the supreme spiritual master. When we speak of Kṛṣṇa, we include His confidential devotees; Kṛṣṇa is not alone. Kṛṣṇa includes His name, His form, His qualities, His abode, His associates, etc. For example, a king is always associated with his secretary, his commander, his servant and so much paraphernalia. As soon as we accept Kṛṣṇa and His associates as our preceptors, no ill effects can destroy our knowledge. In the material world the knowledge we acquire may change because of the influence of time, but nevertheless the conclusions received from //Bhagavad-gītā,// directly from the speeches of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, can never change. There is no use interpreting //Bhagavad-gītā;// it is eternal. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, should be accepted as one's best friend. He will never cheat. He will always give His friendly advice and protection to the devotee. If Kṛṣṇa is accepted as a son, He will never die. Here we may have a very loving son or child, but the father and mother, or those who are affectionate toward him, always hope, \"May my son not die.\" But Kṛṣṇa actually never will die. Therefore those who accept Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Lord, as their son will never be bereft of their son. In many instances devotees have accepted the Deity as a son. In Bengal there are many such instances, and even after the death of the devotee, the Deity performs the //śrāddha// ceremony for the father. The relationship is never destroyed. People are accustomed to worship different forms of demigods, but in //Bhagavad-gītā// such a mentality is condemned; therefore one should be intelligent enough to worship only the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His different forms such as Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, Sītā-Rāma and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.",

The conclusion is that time cannot act upon devotees who have accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as everything. Spiritual life is eternal; it cannot be destroyed. Whatever we have here in the material world is subject to destruction. In this material world we aspire for a nice house, good property, children, friends and riches, but ultimately all of these will be destroyed, including ourselves. Nothing here is permanent; therefore everything is called illusory. Actually we do not understand this; we take all this as permanent. The fact is, however, that only Kṛṣṇa is permanent. Kṛṣṇa's material energy is not permanent. Māyāvādīs think that in the spiritual world there are no relationships. However, in the //śāstras// it is stated that in the spiritual world there is real life. Life in this material world is simply a shadow of that life. In the Fifteenth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// this material world is likened to a banyan tree with its roots above and branches below. This means that it is like a shadow. When we stand beside a reservoir of water, we see the tree reflected upside down. We also have the experience of a mirage in the material world. We think that there is water, but actually there is none. Sometimes sailors at sea think they see land, but actually this is a mirage in the water. This material world is like that. In our lives we think we are enjoying some //rasa,// some relationship. Our children are calling us father, and we are enjoying our relationship with our wife, but all of these relationships are like shadows, although people have no information of this. The true enjoyment derived from these relationships can be attained in the spiritual world with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa therefore comes in person to teach us that we can enjoy the same relationship with Him. We can enjoy Him as our master, our friend, our son, our father or our lover. The Māyāvādī philosophers say that",

This means that one should not try to be happy in this world or to be promoted to the heavenly world, nor should he strive for material wealth, children, houses or cows. How liberation is imperceptibly achieved by a pure devotee and what the symptoms are have been explained. The situation with a conditioned soul is different, however. If he is in the mode of goodness, he may be preparing for promotion to the higher planets; if he is in the mode of passion, he will remain here in a society where activity is very prominent, and if he is in the mode of ignorance, he may be degraded to animal life or a lower grade of human life. But for a devotee there is no concern for this life or the next life because in any life he does not desire material elevation. He prays to the Lord, \"My dear Lord, it does not matter where I am born, but let me be born, even as an ant, in the house of a devotee.\" A pure devotee does not pray to the Lord for liberation from this material bondage. Actually, the pure devotee never thinks that he is fit for liberation. Considering his past life and his mischievous activities, he thinks that he is fit to be sent to the lowest region of hell. If in this life I am trying to become a devotee, this does not mean that in my many past lives I was one hundred percent pious. That is not possible. A devotee, therefore, is always conscious of his real position. Only by his full surrender to the Lord, by the Lord's grace, are his sufferings mitigated. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// \"Surrender unto Me, and I will give you protection from all kinds of sinful reaction.\" That is His mercy. But this does not mean that one who has surrendered to the lotus feet of the Lord has committed no misdeeds in his past life. A devotee always prays, \"For my misdeeds, may I be born again and again, but my only prayer is that I may not forget Your service.\" The devotee has such mental strength, and he prays to the",

    "text": "Lord: \"May I be born again and again, but let me be born in the home of Your pure devotee so that I may again get a chance to develop my spiritual life.\" A pure devotee is not anxious to elevate himself in his next birth. He has already given up that sort of hope. In any life in which one is born, as a householder, or even as an animal, he must have some children, some resources or some possessions, but a devotee is not anxious to possess anything. He is satisfied with whatever is obtainable by God's grace. He is not at all attached to improving his social status or the education of his children. He is not neglectful---he is dutiful---but he does not spend too much time on the improvement of temporary household or social life. He fully engages in the service of the Lord, and for other affairs he simply spares as much time as absolutely necessary (//yathārham upayuñjataḥ//). Such a pure devotee does not care what is going to happen in the next life or in this life; he does not care even for family, children or society. He fully engages in the service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// that without the knowledge of the devotee, the Lord arranges for His devotee to be immediately transferred to His transcendental abode just after leaving his body. After quitting his body he does not go into the womb of another mother. The ordinary common living entity, after death, is transferred to the womb of another mother, according to his //karma,// or activities, to take another type of body. But as far as the devotee is concerned, he is at once transferred to the spiritual world in the association of the Lord. That is the Lord's special mercy. Because He is all-powerful, the Lord can do anything and everything. He can excuse all sinful reactions. He can immediately transfer a person to Vaikuṇṭhaloka. That is the inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is favorably disposed to the pure devotees. In these verses, Kapiladeva is describing the devotee's acceptance of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the most dear to us. If we want to love Kṛṣṇa as a son, Kṛṣṇa is prepared",

Similarly, Kṛṣṇa gives the living entities bodies, 8,400,000 different types of bodies. The living entity gets into the body just as a person gets into a car, and he goes this way and that. We can drive this machine called the body for so many years; then it becomes old, and we have to change it for another machine. This is the process of birth and death. We drive one car for a while, and the car is finally broken, or it is smashed. We may have an accident or not, but eventually the car has to go to the junk yard. Then we have to get another car. Actually our position is that we never take birth and never die, but why have we been put into this position of accepting these machines? This is our real problem. What is the cause of this? We want to enjoy this material world with its wealth and possessions. As long as we are after material possessions, we cannot transcend the cycle of birth and death. However, we have to give up all this and take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and worship Him. Nor can we worship Him whimsically, but as He desires.

The Māyāvādīs say that Brahman has no //rūpa,// no form, and they suggest that we imagine some form. This is not the case with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is present in His original form, and He is described in Vedic literatures. We have recounted these descriptions before. If we want to attain a body like Brahmā's, we can get it. If we want a body like a worm in stool, we can get it. Or, if we want a body like Kṛṣṇa's, we can get that also. That is our real body of //sac-cid-ānanda.// We can also get a body like a demigod's and go to the heavenly planets. Or we can remain here in the middle planetary system.

We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, but somehow or other we have forgotten this. In //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|(Madhya 20.117)]] it is said: > kṛṣṇa bhuli' sei jīva anādi-bahirmukha > ataeva māyā tāre deya saṁsāra-duḥkha \"Forgetting Kṛṣṇa, the living entity has been attracted by the external feature from time immemorial.

In this Kali-yuga, people are forgetting Kṛṣṇa more and more. They are not even interested in Him, but Kṛṣṇa is interested because we are His sons. A mad son may no longer be interested in his home, in his father or mother, yet the father never loses interest in his son. He is anxious because his boy has left home and is suffering.

It is said, //hariṁ vinā naiva sṛtiṁ taranti.// One cannot surpass the cycle of birth and death unless one is favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The same concept is confirmed herewith: one may take to the system of understanding the Absolute Truth by one's own imperfect sensory speculation, or one may try to realize the self by the mystic //yoga// process; but whatever one may do, unless he comes to the point of surrendering to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, no process can give him liberation. One may ask if this means that those who are undergoing so much penance and austerity by strictly following the rules and regulations are endeavoring in vain. The answer is given by //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [[books:sb:10:2:32|(10.2.32)]]: //ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ.// Lord Brahmā and other demigods prayed to the Lord when Kṛṣṇa was in the womb of Devakī: \"My dear lotus-eyed Lord, there are persons who are puffed up with the thought that they have become liberated or one with God or have become God, but they are unintelligent.\" It is stated that their intelligence, whether high or low, is not even purified. With purified intelligence, a living entity cannot think otherwise than to surrender. //Bhagavad-gītā,// therefore, confirms that purified intelligence arises in a very wise man. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. After many, many births, one who is actually advanced in intelligence surrenders unto the Supreme Lord. Without surrendering, one cannot achieve liberation.

He must engage himself in the service of the Supreme Brahman; that is //bhakti.// The engagement of Brahman should be the service of Parabrahman. It is said that unless one becomes Brahman, one cannot serve Brahman. The Supreme Brahman is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the living entity is also Brahman. Without realizing that he is Brahman, spirit soul, an eternal servitor of the Lord, if one simply thinks that he is Brahman, his realization is only theoretical. He has to realize and at the same time engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord; then he can exist in the Brahman status. Otherwise he falls down. The //Bhāgavatam// says that because nondevotees neglect the transcendental loving service of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, their intelligence is not pure, and therefore they fall down. The living entity must have some activity. If he does not engage in the activity of transcendental service, he must fall down to material activity. As soon as one falls down to material activity, there is no rescue from the cycle of birth and death. It is stated here by Lord Kapila, \"Without My mercy\" (//nānyatra mad-bhagavataḥ//). The Lord is stated here to be Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, indicating that He is full of all opulences and is therefore perfectly competent to deliver one from the cycle of birth and death. He is also called //pradhāna// because He is the Supreme. He is equal to everyone, but to one who surrenders to Him He is especially favorable. It is also confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// that the Lord is equal to everyone; no one is His enemy and no one is His friend. But to one who surrenders unto Him, He is especially inclined. By the grace of the Lord, simply by surrendering unto Him one can get out of this cycle of birth and death.

At the time of death there are many troubles, and we become very fearful. Sometimes, when a person is dying, he falls into a coma and lies unconscious. We do not know what kind of fearful test this person is undergoing. He may be dreaming so many things, or he may be crying. He cannot express what is going on. Those who are very sinful especially die in that way. After death, one has to enter into the womb of another mother. That is also a very fearful stage. One becomes packed in a bag, and this bag is filled with stool and urine, and one has to remain packed in this airtight bag for nine months. This is a horrible situation, but we have forgotten all about it. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// that our real trouble is //janma-mṛtyu//---birth and death. When the living entity is packed in the womb, unable to move, he prays to God, \"Please relieve me from this horrible condition. If You relieve me, I shall worship You.\" Finally, after nine months, the living entity emerges from the womb, and then he also undergoes so many troubles trying to adjust to the atmosphere of a new planet. As an infant, he cries and cries, and he is totally dependent on his mother's mercy. Sometimes a mother cannot understand what the child wants. Sometimes an ant may be biting the child, but the mother thinks that the child is hungry. There are bugs, worms, mosquitoes, stool, urine and so many things attacking the new body. These are the threefold miseries, yet we think that we have made such progress. We are being attacked moment after moment by one thing after another, yet people close their eyes to birth, old age, disease and death.

Actually his problems are not solved. He may have some temporary facilities, but the main problem is still there. Every minute, every second, people are dying and going to Yamarāja. Those who are living are thinking that they will not die. They see that their friends are dying, but somehow or other they think that they are eternal. Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja said that this was the most amazing thing in the world. No one thinks that he is going to die, although everyone else is dying. The living entity thinks that he is very happy in whatever body he gets. He may get the body of a dog or the body of a cat, but he is happy in his body, and he does not want to lose it. This is called illusion. When an ant sees danger, he will run like anything. This is because he values his body and does not want to lose it.

He was going about on earth enjoying his hog body when finally Lord Brahmā came and told him, \"My dear Indra, you have suffered enough.

Let me remain here.\" In this way, everyone is thinking that he is very happy, although he is in a horrible and fearsome condition. However, one who is actually intelligent can understand that he is not actually happy, that he is suffering. It is said that ignorance is bliss, but this is the bliss of a hog.

The beginning of knowledge is to understand that we are the eternal sons and servants of Kṛṣṇa. There is no difference between a son and a servant. The son serves the father, just as the servant serves the master. There is affection between master and servant and son and father.

No one should think that nature is working automatically, without superintendence. The Vedic literature says that the clouds are controlled by the demigod Indra, heat is distributed by the sun-god, the soothing moonlight is distributed by Candra and the air is blowing under the arrangement of the demigod Vāyu. But above all these demigods is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the chief living entity. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// (Kaṭha Upaniṣad 2.2.13). The demigods are also ordinary living entities, but due to their faithfulness---their devotional service---they have been promoted to such posts. These different demigods, or directors, such as Candra, Varuṇa and Vāyu, are called //adhikāri-devatā.// The demigods are departmental heads. The government of the Supreme Lord consists not only of one planet or two or three; there are millions of planets and millions of universes. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has a huge government, and He requires assistants. The demigods are considered His bodily limbs. These are described in Vedic literature. The sun-god, moon-god, fire-god and air-god are working under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā// (9. 10), //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.// The natural laws are being conducted under His superintendence. Because He is in the background, everything is being performed punctually and regularly. One who has taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is completely protected from all other influences. He no longer serves or is obliged to anyone else. Of course he is not disobedient to anyone, but his full power of thought is absorbed in the service of the Lord.

In //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.44) it is said that material nature is so powerful that it can create, maintain and destroy in itself: //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā.// However, material nature is working just like a shadow. If we place our hand before a light, we can see its shadow move on a wall. Similarly, material nature is working due to the touch of spirit soul. It is not possible for an automobile to drive itself. A person, a spirit soul, must be within to push certain buttons. Due to the touch of the spirit soul, the machine is moving. The entire universe is similarly moving due to the touch of God. According to the //śāstras,// the wind is blowing, the water is moving, the sun is shining and the earth is revolving under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If the directors of the different material elements do not work properly, they are punished by their master, Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth, He saw that Lord Indra, the lord of the heavens and of rain, was somewhat puffed up. Kṛṣṇa therefore advised His father Nanda Mahārāja not to bother worshiping Indra. He told His father, \"There is no need to offer sacrifices to Indra. It is better to worship Govardhana Hill, which is the representative of God. The cows receive their grass and grains from Govardhana Hill; therefore it is better to worship it.\" At first, Nanda Mahārāja was not willing to do this, but out of affection for Kṛṣṇa, he finally agreed. When Indra saw that Nanda Mahārāja was worshiping Govardhana Hill, he became very angry and sent vicious clouds to inundate all of Vṛndāvana with a flood. Kṛṣṇa then showed Indra that his power was not even competent to deal with the little finger of His left hand. Therefore Kṛṣṇa lifted Govardhana Hill with the small finger of His left hand and used it as an umbrella to save all the people of Vṛndāvana from Indra's torrents. All of this is related in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Thus everyone is a servant. No one can actually claim to be master. If we simply take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, we do not have to offer sacrifices to",

He cries in the street, \"Where is my father? Where is my mother?\" If we no longer want to be in such a fearful condition, we have to take shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

We are making one plan after another to be happy in this material world, but this place is certified by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]], a place of misery. This material world is actually //meant// for misery, just as a prison house is meant for punishment. Once we attain our constitutional position of //brahma-bhūta [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]],// we can enter the kingdom of God, the spiritual world. By //karma-yoga// we attempt to get out of the gross body, and by //jñāna-yoga// we attempt to get out of the subtle body, but by //bhakti-yoga// we can directly transcend both the subtle body (mind, intelligence and ego) and the gross material body. Then we can be situated on the spiritual platform in our original, spiritual body. As long as we are in the subtle and gross bodies, we are suffering under the three modes of material nature. Once we enter into the devotional service of the Lord, we are immediately situated on the platform of //brahma-bhūta. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi// (\"I am Brahman\") is simply theoretical knowledge, but when one actually renders devotional service, one is situated in practical knowledge. Then one is no longer on the material platform but on the Brahman platform. Prahlāda Mahārāja rendered the best service to his father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, by having him killed by Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva.

It is confirmed by the Lord that not only does a Vaiṣṇava's father, but everyone for twenty-one generations before a Vaiṣṇava receives liberation. Thus by serving the Lord, one renders the best service to his family, because twenty-one generations are liberated if one becomes a pure Vaiṣṇava. The //yogī's// real business is to focus his mind on Kṛṣṇa. That is the real //yoga// system. There are many gymnastics performed by //yogīs,// but all this is recommended for those who are overly concerned with the body.

There is a great difference between a //bhakti-yogī// and an ordinary //karmī.// Ordinary //karmīs// cannot understand that the //bhaktas// are on the transcendental platform.

Once Kṛṣṇa left the //gopīs// and changed into His four-handed Viṣṇu form. The //gopīs// went out searching for Kṛṣṇa, and when they saw the four-handed Viṣṇu form, they did not offer much respect. They simply wanted to see Kṛṣṇa. Actually there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu, but every devotee has a particular inclination. In the Vaiṣṇava-sampradāya, some devotees worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and others worship Sītā-Rāma and Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. Some also worship Rukmiṇī-Kṛṣṇa.

    "text": "Kapila Muni, a renowned sage of antiquity, is the author of the philosophical system known as Sāṅkhya, which forms an important part of India's ancient philosophical heritage. Sāṅkhya is both a system of metaphysics, dealing with the elemental principles of the physical universe, and a system of spiritual knowledge, with its own methodology, culminating in full consciousness of the Supreme Absolute. Kapila, however, is not an ordinary philosopher or sage. According to Vedic tradition, the tradition of India's ancient scriptural literature, He Himself is an //avatāra// (incarnation) of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Kapila's teachings are originally inscribed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// or //Bhāgavata Purāṇa,// one of the most important scriptural documents of Vedic theism. Within the //Bhāgavatam,// Kapila's teachings comprise Chapters Twenty-five through Thirty-three of the Third Canto. This book, //Teachings of Lord Kapila, the Son of Devahūti,// is based on a unique series of lectures presented in Bombay, India, in the spring of this series, Śrīla Prabhupāda spoke from the Twenty-fifth Chapter [[books:sb:3:25:1|[SB 3.25.1]]], which contains the beginning of Lord Kapila's teachings. Śrīla Prabhupāda is the author of a celebrated multivolume translation and commentary on the entire text of the //Bhāgavatam,// and at the time of the Kapila lectures he had already completed his written commentary on the section of the //Bhāgavatam// dealing with Kapiladeva's teachings. In these special lectures, however, Śrīla Prabhupāda went into significantly greater detail in elucidating the verses and shed an even broader light upon these fascinating teachings. The text begins with the words of Śaunaka, the foremost of the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya, the vastly learned sages to whom //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was originally spoken some thousands of years ago. The sages have already heard about Lord Kapiladeva from Sūta Gosvāmī, an exalted spiritual master, and it is clear from Śaunaka's words that they accept Kapila Muni as being an incarnation of the Lord Himself and as therefore being the highest authority on //yoga// and transcendental knowledge. In recounting the history of Lord Kapila, Sūta Gosvāmī, in accordance with Vedic principles for presenting spiritual knowledge, refers to discourse by great spiritual masters who have previously discussed this same subject. In this case, Sūta Gosvāmī refers to a discussion between Vidura and the great sage Maitreya, who was a friend of Vyāsadeva, the original compiler of the Vedic literature. As Sūta Gosvāmī has",

Both Kardama Muni and Devahūti were aware of the divinity of their son. Indeed, even before Kapila's birth, Lord Brahmā himself, the chief created person in this universe, had appeared before Devahūti and revealed to her that her son was to be an incarnation of the Supreme Lord and that this incarnation would enlighten her with spiritual knowledge. According to the Vedic social system, a man with a grown son may accept the order of //sannyāsa,// thus renouncing all connections with his family and worldly life, and entrust his wife to the care of his son. Kardama Muni, of course, knew that his son was an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, yet to honor this Vedic system and emphasize its importance, he too eventually accepted //sannyāsa,// entrusting his wife, Devahūti, to the care of his divine son, Kapiladeva. Therefore, as Sūta Gosvāmī begins to answer Śaunaka's request to hear further about Lord Kapiladeva, the sages have already been informed of how Kardama Muni departed for the forest, leaving Kapiladeva behind with Devahūti. After Kardama Muni's departure, Devahūti, remembering the prophetic words of Lord Brahmā, approaches her divine son and humbly expresses her desire for spiritual enlightenment: \"My Lord, I have fallen into the abyss of ignorance. Your Lordship is my only means of getting out of this darkest region of ignorance because You are my transcendental eye, which, by Your mercy only, I have attained after many, many births.... Now be pleased, my Lord, to dispel my great delusion... You are the ax which can cut the tree of material existence. I therefore offer my obeisances to You, who are the greatest of all transcendentalists, and I inquire from You as to the relationship between man and woman and between spirit and matter.\" [[books:sb:3:25:7|(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.25.7-11)]] Pleased by His mother's pure desire for spiritual enlightenment, and feeling great compassion for her, Kapila begins to speak on the Sāṅkhya philosophy. Now, what is Sāṅkhya? Insofar as Sāṅkhya deals with the elemental categories or principles of the physical universe, Sāṅkhya is what Western scholars generally refer to as \"metaphysics.\" The term //sāṅkhya// literally means \"to count.\" This name is used because Sāṅkhya philosophy enumerates",

    "text": "principles of cosmic evolution by rational analysis. The etymological meaning of the word //sāṅkhya// is \"that which explains very lucidly by analysis of material elements.\" Philosophically, this term is used because the Sāṅkhya system expounds analytical knowledge that enables one to distinguish between matter and spirit. This understanding culminates in //bhakti,// devotion for and service to the Supreme. It may be said, therefore, that Sāṅkhya and //bhakti// form two aspects of the same process, //bhakti// being the ultimate goal or ultimate aspect of Sāṅkhya. It is interesting to note, at this point, that long after Lord Kapila's descent, an imitation Kapila appeared on the Indian subcontinent and propounded a nontheistic Sāṅkhya. That which is generally studied as Sāṅkhya in the contemporary academic context is actually this later, nontheistic, materialistic Sāṅkhya. The Sāṅkhya philosophy, propounded by the original Kapila, is practically unknown in the West. //Teachings of Lord Kapila, the Son of Devahūti// (along with Śrīla Prabhupāda's complete commentary on Kapila's Sāṅkhya in his edition of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam//) is probably the first major exposition in the English language on the original, theistic Sāṅkhya. It should therefore be of considerable interest to scholars in this field. Because the basic principle and the ultimate goal of Lord Kapiladeva's Sāṅkhya philosophy is //bhakti,// this is the subject with which Lord Kapiladeva begins His instructions to Devahūti. Consequently, because this volume, //Teachings of Lord Kapila, the Son of Devahūti,// is Śrīla Prabhupāda's commentary on the beginning of Lord Kapila's teachings, it is chiefly concerned with the science of //bhakti-yoga//---the process of linking with God (//yoga// means \"linking\") through //bhakti// (devotion). As the actual history begins, Devahūti approaches her son, Kapila, and with deep humility expresses her sincere desire for spiritual enlightenment. In response, Lord Kapila delineates \"the path of the transcendentalists, who are interested in self-realization.\" Concisely summarizing the actual process of self-realization, Kapila defines consciousness in both the conditioned and liberated states. He describes the psychology of pure consciousness, delineates the symptoms and characteristics of a //sādhu,// holy person, and stresses the importance of //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]], association with those who are saintly. Kapiladeva then explains that liberation is merely a stage preliminary to the attainment of //bhakti// and that one who attains //bhakti// automatically achieves liberation. One who engages in //bhakti,// devotional //yoga,// automatically transcends material desires",

Thus //asad-indriya-tarṣaṇāt// means \"from being agitated by the temporarily manifest senses of the material body.\" We are evolving through different species of material bodily existence---sometimes in a human body, sometimes in an animal body---and therefore the engagements of our material senses are also changing. Anything which changes is called temporary, or //asat.// We should know that beyond these temporary senses are our permanent senses, which are now covered by the material body. The permanent senses, being contaminated by matter, are not acting properly. Devotional service, therefore, involves freeing the senses from this contamination. When the contamination is completely removed and the senses act in the purity of unalloyed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we have then attained //sad-indriya,// or eternal sense activities. Eternal sensory activities are called devotional service, whereas temporary sensory activities are called sense gratification. Unless one becomes tired of material sense gratification, there is no opportunity to hear transcendental messages from a person like Kapila. Devahūti expressed that she was tired. Now that her husband had left home, she wanted to get relief by hearing the instructions of Lord Kapila. The Vedic literatures describe this material world as darkness. Actually it is dark, and therefore we require sunlight, moonlight and electricity. If it were not by nature dark, why would we require so many arrangements for artificial light? The //Vedas// enjoin that we should not remain in darkness: //tamasi mā jyotir gama.// We are instructed to go to the light, and that light is the spiritual world, which is directly lighted by the effulgence, or bodily rays, of Kṛṣṇa. As stated in //Brahma-saṁhitā// (5.40): > yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi- > koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam > tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ > govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi \"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is endowed with great power.

Like Devahūti, an intelligent person should become disgusted with the darkness of ignorance. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.// As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:20|(2.20)]], there is neither birth nor death for the soul. The soul is not destroyed when the body is annihilated. The soul puts bodies on and takes them off like clothes. This simple knowledge is instructed in the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā,// yet there are many big scholars and leaders who still cannot understand that the body is different from the person. This is because they do not study //Bhagavad-gītā// in the proper way. Consequently no one is fully aware or convinced that the real person is not the body. This is called darkness, and when one is disgusted with this darkness, human life begins. One who has become disgusted with material existence needs the instructions of a //guru. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. Being the wife of a great //yogī,// Devahūti understood her constitutional position; therefore she is placing her problem before her son, Kapiladeva, an incarnation of God. Although Kapiladeva is her son, Devahūti does not hesitate to take instructions from Him. She does not say, \"Oh, He is my son. What can He tell me? I am His mother, and I shall instruct Him.\" Instruction has to be taken from one who is in knowledge. It doesn't matter what his position is, whether he is a son, a boy, a //śūdra, brāhmaṇa, sannyāsī// or //gṛhastha.// One should simply learn from one who knows. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction. Although Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself was a //brāhmaṇa// and a //sannyāsī,// He took instructions from Rāmānanda Rāya, who was a //śūdra// and //gṛhastha// but nonetheless, very exalted spiritually. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw that Rāmānanda Rāya was hesitant to give instructions, the Lord said, \"Why are you hesitating?

Thus it is not birth that is important, but qualification. Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted everyone in India to know the science of Kṛṣṇa and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is very simple. We need only repeat what Kṛṣṇa has said or what has been said about Kṛṣṇa in the Vedic literatures. Human society cannot be happy without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer, and we are His servants. The master is enjoying, and the servants are helping the master enjoy. We living entities are eternal servants of God, and our duty is to help our master enjoy. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the topmost servant of Kṛṣṇa, and Her business is always to keep Kṛṣṇa pleased. Kṛṣṇa is very fond of Rādhārāṇī because She renders the best service. Her sixty-four qualifications are mentioned in the Vedic literatures. Unfortunately, in the material world we are busy trying to enjoy our material senses. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:3:42|(3.42)]]: > indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur > indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ > manasas tu parā buddhir > yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ \"The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he (the soul) is even higher than the intelligence.\" The soul is on the spiritual platform. this way we become implicated in the laws of nature.

In the street we see many dogs assembled for sex. This may seem very crude, but human beings are engaged in the same business, perhaps in a more elaborate way. We should know that sense gratification is meant for animals, and that sense control is for human beings. By //tapasya,// penance, we can purify ourselves and regain our eternal life. Actually our material senses are not our real senses. They are covered, just as the body is covered by clothes. Our real body is within the material body. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. The spiritual body is within the material body. The material body is changing, going through childhood, youth, then old age, and then it vanishes. Although this is not our real body, we are engaged in sense gratification with it. However, for our own ultimate happiness, we should try to purify our senses. There is no question of destroying the senses or becoming desireless. Desire is a material activity, and becoming desireless is not possible. The senses must be purified in order for us to act through them transcendentally. //Bhakti-yoga// does not require us to destroy our senses, but to purify them. When the senses are purified, we can serve Kṛṣṇa: > sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ > tat-paratvena nirmalam > hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa- > sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate > [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc.

When we purify our senses, we can act in our original constitutional position and serve Kṛṣṇa. When we forget our position and try to satisfy ourselves, we become conditioned materially. When we forget that our duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa, we fall into the material world and become implicated in personal sense gratification. As long as we continue trying to satisfy our own senses, we have to accept another body. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that if we want to become tigers, He will give us a tiger body. If we want to become devotees, He will give us the body of a devotee. This life is a preparation for the next, and if we want to enjoy our transcendental senses, we have to purify ourselves to return home, back to Godhead.

In order to see God, we have to cleanse our eyes by wiping away the cataracts of material contamination. Although we may be eager to see God, we cannot see Him with these material eyes. Not only can we not see Him, but we cannot understand Him, although His name is there. Understanding God means first of all understanding His name. Therefore from the beginning we should chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// God is not different from His name. Kṛṣṇa's name and Kṛṣṇa's person are the same. \"Absolute\" means that Kṛṣṇa's name, form, place, dress, pastimes and everything are nondifferent from Him.

Because everything is diminishing, God consciousness is diminishing also; therefore it is natural to receive news that faith in a personal God is diminishing.

Everyone should know what is Bhagavān and take lessons from Bhagavān. Lord Kapila is Bhagavān, and He personally instructed His mother in Sāṅkhya philosophy. By this knowledge we can develop or awaken our dormant love for God. Then we can see God when our eyes are anointed with love for Him. Indeed, we can see God everywhere and at all times.

Any intelligent man can see God while walking down the beach. However, this requires a little intelligence. People who are asses, //mūḍhas, duṣkṛtīs,// cannot see God, but those who are intelligent can see God everywhere because God is omnipresent. He is within the universe and within our heart, and He is even within the atom. Why are we saying that we cannot see Him?

Does this mean that the Lord discriminates by engaging one in His devotional service and another in sense gratification? If that were true, it would be an incongruity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but that is not the actual fact. As soon as the living entity forgets his real constitutional position of eternal servitorship to the Lord and wants instead to enjoy himself by sense gratification, he is captured by //māyā.// This capture leads to the consciousness of false identification with the body and attachment for the possessions of the body. These are the activities of //māyā,// and since //māyā// is also an agent of the Lord, it is indirectly the action of the Lord.

Now kindly get me free from this entanglement.\" By the grace of the Lord one is allowed to enjoy this material world, but when one is disgusted with material enjoyment and is frustrated, and when one sincerely surrenders unto the lotus feet of the Lord, then the Lord is so kind that He frees one from entanglement. Kṛṣṇa says, therefore, in //Bhagavad-gītā,// \"First of all surrender, and then I will take charge of you and free you from all reactions of sinful activities.\" Sinful activities are those activities performed in forgetfulness of our relationship with the Lord. In this material world, activities for material enjoyment that are considered pious are also sinful. For example, one sometimes gives money in charity to a needy person with a view to get back the money four times increased. Giving with the purpose of gaining something is called charity in the mode of passion. Everything done here is done in the modes of material nature, and therefore all activities but service to the Lord are sinful. Because of sinful activities we become attracted by the illusion of material attachment, and we think, \"I am this body.\" I think of the body as myself and of bodily possessions as \"mine.\" Devahūti requested Lord Kapila to free her from that entanglement of false identification and false possession. In asking this, Devahūti is accepting her son, Kapila, as her //guru.// He consequently tells her how to solve all material problems. Material life is nothing but sex attraction. //puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|(SB 5.5.8)]]. Material life means that men are after women and women are after men. We find this not only in human society but in bird, dog, cat and demigod society. As soon as people join to satisfy their sex desire, the attraction becomes greater and greater. An apartment is needed for privacy, and then one has to earn a livelihood and acquire some land. Without children, married life is frustrated, and of course the children have to be educated.

That is the cause of //saṁsāra-bandha,// or conditional life. Devahūti wanted to get out of conditional life and place herself in full surrender. The Lord is //śaraṇya,// which means \"the only worthy personality to whom one can fully surrender,\" because He is full of all opulences. If anyone actually wants relief, the best course is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is also described here as //sad-dharma-vidāṁ variṣṭham.// This indicates that of all transcendental occupations, the best is eternal loving service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Dharma// is sometimes translated as \"religion,\" but that is not exactly the meaning. //Dharma// actually means \"that which one cannot give up,\" \"that which is inseparable from oneself.\" The warmth of fire is inseparable from fire; therefore warmth is called the //dharma,// or nature, of fire. Similarly, //sad-dharma// means \"eternal occupation.\" That eternal occupation is engagement in the transcendental loving service of the Lord.

Without Kṛṣṇa's permission, we cannot do anything. Why does Kṛṣṇa give us permission to do something wrong? He does so because we persist.

If we take advantage of electricity, we have to pay the bill, but we don't pay the sun bill. This means that we are actually indebted to the sun-god, Vivasvān. Similarly, the King of heaven, Indra, is supplying water in the form of rain. Rascals say that all this comes about by nature, but they do not know that nature is controlled. If we don't pay our debts by performing sacrifices, there will certainly be a scarcity.

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement preaches that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa and that everything should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's benefit.

There are many American and European boys and girls in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement who have been born in countries where they can enjoy a good deal of material affluence, but they consider this material happiness and affluence like garbage in the street.

That detachment is the sign that one is advancing in //bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca// (SB 11.2.42). That is the test of advancing in //bhakti.// If we are advanced, we are no longer attached to material enjoyment.",

    "text": "It is not that we think ourselves great devotees and then go ahead and enjoy material things. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:22|(5.22)]]: > ye hi saṁsparśa-jā bhogā > duḥkha-yonaya eva te > ādy-antavantaḥ kaunteya > na teṣu ramate budhaḥ \"An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery, which are due to contact with the material senses. O son of Kuntī, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, and so the wise man does not delight in them.\" When one sees something superior, he immediately rejects that which is inferior. Actually we cannot bring all this about by our own endeavor; therefore we have to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, and He will help. Since our only business is to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, Devahūti says, \"I am taking shelter of You so that You can cut my attachment to this material life. Why should You do this? Because I am Your eternal servant.\" Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, //anādi karama-phale, paḍi 'bhavārṇava-jale, taribāre nā dekhi upāya.// If we are thrown into the ocean, there is a great struggle, even if we may be very great swimmers. There is no peace in this material world, however expert we may be in dealing with it. There is nothing but struggle. We cannot live here peacefully. It is not possible. Even if we are nonviolent and hurt no one, there will be trouble. However, if somehow or other we manage to reach the shore, we will find peace. There is peace even if we are an inch out of the water. //Tava pāda-paṅkaja-sthita-dhūlī sadṛśaṁ vicintaya// (//Śikṣāṣṭaka// 5). If somehow or other we become one of the particles of dust at Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, we will be liberated. We may be a Hindu or a Muslim or a Christian for fifty or sixty years, or at the utmost one hundred, but again we have to take birth and be something else. We are thinking in terms of these religious designations, which are called //asad-dharma,// meaning that they may change at any moment. But what is our real //dharma?// Real //dharma// is //sad-dharma,// that which will not change, and this //sad-dharma// necessitates surrendering unto Kṛṣṇa. This //dharma// will continue eternally. There are many propounders of //sad-dharma,// but actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the best propounder",
