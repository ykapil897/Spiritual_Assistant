### 📖 The Power of Hearing


**Prabhupāda:** We speak, discuss about **Bhagavad-gītā**. They hear. They hear **Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam**. You have seen our books? So these books are discussed, and gradually... If it is a fact, **śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ**, if one gives only aural reception to this transcendental message, then, although God is Ajita, nobody can conquer, He becomes conquered. So that is becoming, happening, that although they are American, European, Canadian, African, Australian---not all of them are Indian; Indians are also there---but because they are giving aural reception to this transcendental message, they are becoming enlightened. So anyone who will give aural reception to this message---first of all **Bhagavad-gītā**, entrance, then **Bhāgavatam**, then **Caitanya-caritāmṛta**, like books---then gradually he'll be self-realized, fully cognizant what is God. What is God, this is... **Athāto brahma jijñāsā** means what is God. So this institution is meant for giving chance to everyone to hear. It doesn't require education. Simply God has given him this ear. Let him receive the message from the ear. **Śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ**. This is the process. Very simple process: simply to hear, sincerely, then everything will be done gradually.


**Prabhupāda:** Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, **ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam** [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. By hearing, the mirror of consciousness... Consciousness is just like a mirror---it is now covered with dust. **Mārjanam**. Mirror, if you cleanse with a duster, then you can see clearly what is your face. So by this chanting process and hearing, gradually the dirty things in the heart will be cleansed. **Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ** [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Simply hearing about Kṛṣṇa is **puṇya**, pious activities. **Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ**. Either you hear or you chant, **puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi**. There are so many dirty things, nonsense things, within the heart. **Hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi, vidhunoti**, is washed.


**Prabhupāda:** [aside:] Who is...? Find out this verse: **Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ**. In the First Canto, first part, Third Chapter.


**Śrutakīrti:** //S-i?

**Śrutakīrti:** //S-i-n?

**Guest:** Can I have a look at it, please?


**Prabhupāda:** Yes, give him. **Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdy antaḥ stho abhadrāṇi** [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]
