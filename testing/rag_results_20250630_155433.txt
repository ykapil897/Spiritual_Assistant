TEXT: ===== Discovering the Self ===== Who are you?... Are you your body? Or your mind? Or are you something higher? Do you know who you are, or do you merely think you know? And does it really matter? Our materialistic society, with its unenlightened leadership, has made it virtually taboo to inquire into our real, higher self. Instead we use our valuable time maintaining, decorating, and pampering the body for its own sake. Might there be an alternative? This very important K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness movement is meant to save human society from spiritual death. At present human society is being misled by leaders who are blind, for they do not know the aim and objective of human life, which is self-realization and the reestablishment of our lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the missing point. The K·πõ·π£·πáa consciousness movement is trying to enlighten human society in this important matter. According to Vedic civilization, the perfection of life is to realize one's relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa, or God. In the //Bhagavad-gƒ´tƒÅ,// which is accepted by all authorities in transcendental science as the basis of all Vedic knowledge, we understand that not only human beings but all living entities are parts and parcels of God. The parts are meant for serving the whole, just as the legs, hands, fingers, and ears are meant for serving the total body. We living entities, being parts and parcels of God, are duty-bound to serve Him. Actually our position is that we are always rendering service to someone, either to our family, country, or society. If we have no one to serve, sometimes we keep a pet cat or dog and render service to it. All these factors prove that we are constitutionally meant to render service, yet in spite of serving to the best of our ability, we are not satisfied. Nor is the person to whom we are rendering that service satisfied. On the material platform, everyone is frustrated. The reason for this is that the service being rendered is not properly directed. For example, if we want to render service to a tree, we must water the root. If we pour water on the leaves, branches, and twigs, there is little benefit. If the Supreme Personality of Godhead is served, all other parts and parcels

TEXT: from K·πõ·π£·πáa; he simply wants to serve Him. And K·πõ·π£·πáa also looks for the opportunity to serve His devotee. K·πõ·π£·πáa is always as anxious to please His devotee as the devotee is to please Him. This is the transcendental world. On the absolute plane, there is no exploitation. Everyone wants to serve; no one wants to take service. In the transcendental world, everyone wants to give service. You want to give service to me, and I want to give service to you. This is such a nice attitude. This material world means that I want to pickpocket you, and you want to pickpocket me. That's all. This is the material world. We should try to understand it. In the material world, everyone wants to exploit his friend, his father, his mother, everyone. But in the transcendental world, everyone wants to serve. Everyone has K·πõ·π£·πáa as the central point of serving, and all the devotees, either as friends or servants or parents or lovers of K·πõ·π£·πáa, all want to serve Him. And at the same time, K·πõ·π£·πáa also wants to serve them. This is a transcendental relationship; the main function is service, although there is no necessity of service, for everyone is full. There is no hunger, there is no necessity of eating, but still everyone offers nice things to eat. This is the transcendental world. Unless we attain the stage of simply serving K·πõ·π£·πáa or His devotee, we cannot relish the transcendental pleasure of service. If we have any motive, then that sense will never be awakened. Without a motive, without desire for personal sense gratification, service should be rendered to the Supreme Lord and His devotees. ===== The Perfection of Self-realization ===== In this concluding chapter, ≈örƒ´la PrabhupƒÅda discusses the ultimate goal of the science of self-realization---full realization of the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa. The development of self-realization begins with the understanding that the self is not material---not a physical body---but pure spiritual energy. Next, one realizes that the pure, spiritual self is eternally a part of the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa. Finally one learns how to live fully in that eternal, blissful, transcendental relationship. One who has attained this state has attained life's supreme perfection. When K·πõ·π£·πáa was on this earth, all the residents of V·πõndƒÅvana loved Him. Indeed, they knew nothing but K·πõ·π£·πáa.

5Ô∏è‚É£ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
üïâ Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada üïâ

As we delve into the profound teachings of Srila Prabhupada's "Science of Self Realization," we're reminded of the importance of understanding our true nature and purpose in life. Let's explore the key points from Chapter 1, which sets the foundation for our spiritual journey.

‚ú® Misled by Blind Leaders ‚ú®

Srila Prabhupada reveals a stark reality: "At present human society is being misled by leaders who are blind, for they do not know the aim and objective of human life, which is self-realization and the reestablishment of our lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/1.txt/)

This quote highlights the crucial issue of our times. We're often guided by leaders who lack spiritual vision, leading us further away from our true goal. It's essential to recognize this and take responsibility for our own self-realization.

‚ú® The Perfection of Life ‚ú®

So, what is the aim and objective of human life? Srila Prabhupada clarifies: "According to Vedic civilization, the perfection of life is to realize one's relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa, or God." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/1.txt/)

This statement emphasizes the importance of understanding our connection with the Supreme. It's not about achieving material success or fleeting happiness but about realizing our eternal relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa.

‚ú® Our Duty as Parts and Parcels of God ‚ú®

As parts and parcels of God, we have a specific role to play: "We living entities, being parts and parcels of God, are duty-bound to serve Him." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/1.txt/)

This quote reminds us of our inherent duty to serve K·πõ·π£·πáa. By recognizing our position as His parts and parcels, we can begin to fulfill our purpose in life.

‚ú® The Ultimate Goal of Self-Realization ‚ú®

While we've explored the importance of self-realization, what is the ultimate goal of this science? Srila Prabhupada explains: "The development of self-realization begins with the understanding that the self is not material---not a physical body---but pure spiritual energy. Next, one realizes that the pure, spiritual self is eternally a part of the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/8.txt/)

This quote highlights the progression of self-realization, culminating in the full realization of our eternal connection with K·πõ·π£·πáa.

‚ú® Reflection and Application ‚ú®

As we reflect on these essential points from "Science of Self Realization," let's ask ourselves: Are we being misled by blind leaders, or are we taking responsibility for our own self-realization? Are we focused on material success or striving to realize our relationship with K·πõ·π£·πáa?

By internalizing these teachings, we can begin to fulfill our duty as parts and parcels of God, ultimately achieving the perfection of life: full realization of our connection with the Supreme Self, K·πõ·π£·πáa.
