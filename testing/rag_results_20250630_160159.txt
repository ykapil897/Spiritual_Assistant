1️⃣ QUERY PROCESSING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Original Query: give the most important points from the ttp book only, first priority is `1ssr only 
Refined Query: Here is the refined query:

`most important points from TTP, relation to SSR`

I removed the `first priority is '1ssr only` part because it seems to be a carryover from the previous queries, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the current query about the TTP book. Instead, I added `relation to SSR` to acknowledge the previous queries and potentially find connections between the two books.

TEXT: ===== Discovering the Self ===== Who are you?... Are you your body? Or your mind? Or are you something higher? Do you know who you are, or do you merely think you know? And does it really matter? Our materialistic society, with its unenlightened leadership, has made it virtually taboo to inquire into our real, higher self. Instead we use our valuable time maintaining, decorating, and pampering the body for its own sake. Might there be an alternative? This very important Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant to save human society from spiritual death. At present human society is being misled by leaders who are blind, for they do not know the aim and objective of human life, which is self-realization and the reestablishment of our lost relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the missing point. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to enlighten human society in this important matter. According to Vedic civilization, the perfection of life is to realize one's relationship with Kṛṣṇa, or God. In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// which is accepted by all authorities in transcendental science as the basis of all Vedic knowledge, we understand that not only human beings but all living entities are parts and parcels of God. The parts are meant for serving the whole, just as the legs, hands, fingers, and ears are meant for serving the total body. We living entities, being parts and parcels of God, are duty-bound to serve Him. Actually our position is that we are always rendering service to someone, either to our family, country, or society. If we have no one to serve, sometimes we keep a pet cat or dog and render service to it. All these factors prove that we are constitutionally meant to render service, yet in spite of serving to the best of our ability, we are not satisfied. Nor is the person to whom we are rendering that service satisfied. On the material platform, everyone is frustrated. The reason for this is that the service being rendered is not properly directed. For example, if we want to render service to a tree, we must water the root. If we pour water on the leaves, branches, and twigs, there is little benefit. If the Supreme Personality of Godhead is served, all other parts and parcels

TEXT: society; there is no difficulty. The only difficulty is, for instance, in the socialistic society---in our country and other socialist societies---how you can distinguish the productive group from the workers. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** For example, we belong to the intellectual class of men. This is a division. **Prof. Kotovsky:** Intelligent class, //brāhmaṇas.// And you can also put together all the intelligentsia in that department. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Yes. **Prof. Kotovsky:** And then the administrative class. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Yes. **Prof. Kotovsky:** But who are the //vaiśyas// and //śūdras?// That is the difficulty. Because all others are workers-factory workers, collective farm workers, and so on. So from this point of view there is a great distinction, in my opinion, between socialist society and all societies preceding socialism, because in modern Western society you can group all social and professional classes in these particular class divisions-//brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas,// and //śūdras:// intellectuals, productive class, owners of the productive system (factory owners, for instance), and menial workers. But here you have no //vaiśyas// because you have administrative staffs in factories, and you can call them //kṣatriyas,// and then there are the //śūdras,// the workers themselves, but no intermediate class. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** That is stated. //Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.// In this age practically all men are //śūdras.// But if there are simply //śūdras,// the social order will be disturbed. In spite of your state of //śūdras,// the //brāhmaṇa// is found here, and that is necessary. If you do not divide the social order in such a way, there will be chaos. That is the scientific estimation of the //Vedas.// You may belong to the //śūdra// class, but to maintain social order you have to train some of the //śūdras// to become //brāhmaṇas.// Society cannot depend on //śūdras.// Nor can you depend on the //brāhmaṇas.// To fulfill the necessities of your body, there must be a brain, arms, a stomach, and legs. The legs, the brain, and the arms are all required for cooperation to fulfill the mission of the whole body. So in any society you can see that unless there are these four divisions, there will be chaos. It will not work properly. It will be //māyā,// and there will be disturbances. The brain must be there, but at the present moment there is a scarcity of brains. I am not talking of

TEXT: disciplic succession. What Vyāsadeva and Kṛṣṇa taught five thousand years ago is also being taught now. There is no difference between the two instructions. Although hundreds and thousands of //ācāryas// have come and gone, the message is one. The real //guru// cannot be two, for the real //guru// does not speak differently from his predecessors. Some spiritual teachers say, "In my opinion you should do this," but this is not a //guru.// Such so-called //gurus// are simply rascals. The genuine //guru// has only one opinion, and that is the opinion expressed by Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Arjuna, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the Gosvāmīs. Five thousand years ago Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa spoke the //Bhagavad-gītā,// and Vyāsadeva recorded it. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not say, "This is my opinion." Rather, he wrote, //śrī-bhagavān uvāca,// that is, "The Supreme Personality of Godhead says." Whatever Vyāsadeva wrote was originally spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrīla Vyāsadeva did not give his own opinion. Consequently, Śrīla Vyāsadeva is a //guru.// He does not misinterpret the words of Kṛṣṇa, but transmits them exactly as they were spoken. If we send a telegram, the person who delivers the telegram does not have to correct it, edit it, or add to it. He simply presents it. That is the //guru's// business. The //guru// may be this person or that, but the message is the same; therefore it is said that //guru// is one. In the disciplic succession we simply find repetition of the same subject. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:9:34|(9.34)]] Śrī Kṛṣṇa says: > man-manā bhava mad-bhakto > mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru > mām evaiṣyasi yuktvaivam > ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ "Engage your mind always in thinking of Me, become My devotee, offer obeisances, and worship Me. Being completely absorbed in Me, surely you will come to Me." These very instructions were reiterated by all the //ācāryas,// such as Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The six Gosvāmīs also transmitted the same message, and we are simply following in their footsteps. There is no difference. We do not interpret the words of Kṛṣṇa by saying, "In my opinion, the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra represents the human body." Such interpretations are set forth by rascals. In the world there are many rascal //gurus// who give their own opinion, but we can challenge any rascal. A rascal //guru// may say, "I
