TEXT: Prahlāda Mahārāja told his friends, "You have to begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately." All the boys were born of atheistic, materialistic families, but fortunately they had the association of Prahlāda, who was a great devotee of the Lord from his birth. Whenever he found an opportunity, when the teacher was out of the classroom, he used to say, "My dear friends, let's chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; this is the time to begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Now, as we have stated, some boy might have said, "But we are just boys. Let us play. We are not going to die immediately. Let us have some enjoyment, and later we shall begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness." People do not know that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest enjoyment. They think that the boys and girls who have joined this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement are foolish. "By Prabhupāda's influence they have joined Kṛṣṇa consciousness and left everything enjoyable." But actually this is not so. They are all intelligent, educated boys and girls, coming from very respectable families; they are not fools. In our Society they are actually enjoying life; otherwise they would not have sacrificed their valuable time for this movement. Actually there is joyful life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but people do not know of it. They say, "What use is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" When one grows up entangled in the sense gratification process, it is very difficult to get out of it. Therefore, according to Vedic regulations, in student life, beginning from five years of age, boys are taught about spiritual life. That is called //brahmacarya.// A //brahmacārī// dedicates his life to attaining supreme consciousness---Kṛṣṇa consciousness or Brahman consciousness. //Brahmacarya// has many rules and regulations. For example, however rich one's father may be, the //brahmacārī// surrenders himself to be trained under the guidance of a spiritual master and works in the ashram of the spiritual master just like a menial servant. How is this possible? We are getting actual experience that very nice boys coming from very respectable families do not hesitate to do any kind of work here. They are washing dishes, cleansing floors---everything. One student's mother was astonished at her boy when he visited home. Before, he would not even go to the store, and now he is engaged twenty-four hours a day. Unless one feels pleasure, how is it possible

TEXT: childhood, begin now, in whatever position you are." That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. He never said, "Because you did not begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness from your childhood, you cannot make progress." No. He is very kind. He has given us this nice process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Whether you are young or old---no matter what you are---just begin. You do not know when your life will be finished. If you chant sincerely, even for a moment, it will have great effect. It will save you from the greatest danger---becoming an animal in your next life. Although only five years old, Prahlāda Mahārāja speaks just like a very experienced and educated man because he received knowledge from his spiritual master, Nārada Muni. That is disclosed in the next chapter of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [7.7]. Wisdom does not depend on age, but on knowledge received from a superior source. One cannot become a wise man simply by advancement of age. No. That is not possible. Knowledge has to be received from a superior source; then one can become wise. It doesn't matter whether one is a five-year-old boy or a fifty-year-old man. As it is said, "By wisdom one becomes an old man, even without advanced age." So although Prahlāda was only five years old, by advancement in knowledge he was imparting perfect instructions to his classmates. Some may find these instructions unpalatable. Suppose a man is already married and Prahlāda says, "Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness." He will think, "Oh, how can I leave my wife? We talk so nicely together, sit together and enjoy. How can I leave?" Family attraction is very strong. I am an old man---seventy-two years old. I have been away from my family during the last fourteen years. Yet sometimes I also think of my wife and children. This is quite natural. But that does not mean I have to go back. This is knowledge. When the mind wanders to thoughts of sense gratification, one should at once understand, "This is illusion." According to the Vedic system, one has to forcibly give up family life at the age of fifty. One must go. There is no alternative. The first twenty-five years are for student life. From age five to

TEXT: nature is sure to commit mistakes. Further, the conditioned soul must become illusioned. This happens when he continually mistakes one thing for something else. For example, we accept the body as the self. Since I am not this body, my acceptance of the body as my self is an illusion. The whole world is going on under the illusion that "I am this body." Therefore there is no peace. I am thinking that I am Indian, you are thinking that you are American, and a Chinese man is thinking that he is Chinese. What is this "Chinese," "American," and "Indian"? It is an illusion based on the body. That's all. The propensity to cheat is the fourth defect of conditioned life. I may be a fool, but I will boast that I am very learned. Everyone who is illusioned and commits mistakes is a fool, but still such fools pose themselves as being sources of infallible knowledge. So all conditioned souls have imperfect senses, they are subject to commit mistakes and become illusioned, and they are influenced by the propensity to cheat. How can one expect real knowledge from such conditioned souls? There is no possibility of receiving actual knowledge from them. Whether a person is a scientist, a philosopher, or whatever, because he is conditioned he cannot give complete information, no matter how educated he may be. That is a fact. One may now ask, How can we get complete information? The process is to receive knowledge via the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples beginning with Kṛṣṇa. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// Lord Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, "This knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā// was first spoken by Me to the sun-god, and the sun-god spoke it to his son, Manu. In turn, Manu spoke this knowledge to his son Ikṣvāku, and then Ikṣvāku spoke the same to his son. In this way the knowledge has come down. But unfortunately that disciplic succession is now broken. Therefore, O Arjuna, I am now imparting the same knowledge to you because you are My very dear friend and good devotee." This is the process of receiving perfect knowledge---to accept the transcendental vibration coming down from higher sources. The entire stock of Vedic knowledge is a transcendental vibration to help us understand the Supreme Lord. So, Prahlāda Mahārāja says

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🕉 Humble Greetings to Srila Prabhupada, the embodiment of Krsna consciousness.

✨ Embracing Krsna Consciousness: A Journey for All Ages

As we embark on the journey of Krsna consciousness, it's essential to understand that age is not a barrier. Srila Prabhupada emphasizes, *"childhood, begin now, in whatever position you are"* [TTP 3, Translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/3.txt/). This statement is a call to action, urging us to start our spiritual journey immediately, regardless of our age or position in life.

✨ The Highest Enjoyment: Surrender and Brahmacarya

Krsna consciousness is not just a philosophical concept, but a tangible reality that can bring us joyful life. Srila Prabhupada assures us, *"Actually there is joyful life in Krsna consciousness, but people do not know of it"* [TTP 3, Translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/3.txt/). To experience this joyful life, we need to surrender to a spiritual master and follow the rules and regulations of brahmacarya. This surrender is not a sign of weakness, but rather a sign of strength, as it allows us to tap into the highest enjoyment that Krsna consciousness has to offer.

✨ Wisdom Beyond Age

In our materialistic society, we often associate wisdom with age. However, Srila Prabhupada teaches us that *"Wisdom does not depend on age, but on knowledge received from a superior source"* [TTP 3, Translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/3.txt/). This statement highlights the importance of receiving knowledge from a qualified spiritual master, rather than relying solely on our own limited understanding.

✨ The Limitations of the Conditioned Soul

As conditioned souls, we are prone to mistakes, illusion, and cheating. Srila Prabhupada reminds us, *"The propensity to cheat is the fourth defect of conditioned life"* [TTP 5, Translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/5.txt/). This means that we cannot rely solely on our own understanding to gain complete knowledge. Instead, we need to seek guidance from a superior source.

✨ The Power of Disciplic Succession

The good news is that we can receive complete knowledge through the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples, beginning with Krsna. Srila Prabhupada explains, *"The process is to receive knowledge via the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples beginning with Krsna"* [TTP 5, Translation](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ttp/5.txt/). This process allows us to tap into the divine wisdom of Krsna, which is beyond the limitations of the conditioned soul.

✨ Reflection and Application

As we reflect on these essential points from the TTP book, let us remember that Krsna consciousness is a journey that is accessible to everyone, regardless of age or position. By surrendering to a spiritual master and following the rules and regulations of brahmacarya, we can experience the highest enjoyment that Krsna consciousness has to offer. Let us seek guidance from a superior source, recognizing the limitations of our own understanding, and tap into the divine wisdom of Krsna through the disciplic succession of spiritual masters and disciples.
