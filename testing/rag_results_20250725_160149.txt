### 📖 The Power of Memory in Ancient Times

**Prabhupāda:** Simply by hearing, they'll remember. That was going on up to the date of Vyāsadeva, five thousand years ago. There was no writing principle. There was no need of writing. People were so much powerful in their memory, they could immediately remember everything by hearing once from the teacher.

**Key Insight: *The ancient Vedic tradition relied on powerful memory and oral transmission.***

### 📖 The Advent of Kali-yuga

**Prabhupāda:** Then Vyāsadeva, when he saw the Kali-yuga is coming, people's memory will be not so sharp, then he wrote all these Vedic literature. He's called Veda-vyāsa. Vedic knowledge was already there by tradition, by hearing, but he chronologically wrote all these.

**Key Insight: *Vyāsadeva wrote the Vedas to preserve Vedic knowledge in the Kali-yuga.***

### 📖 Symptoms of Kali-yuga

**Prabhupāda:** These things will be reduced: **dharma**, truthfulness, cleanliness, and forgiveness and mercifulness. People are not very merciful now. Especially in the Western countries, if one is attacked by another, people will pass. Nobody will care for that. He may be killed. People do not show any mercy. And **kṣamā**. **Kṣamā** means forgiveness. That is also being reduced. Memory reduced, merciful reduced, span of life reduced, bodily strength reduced, health is reduced. This is the symptom of Kali-yuga.

**SHLOKA:**

**kālena balinā rājan naṅkṣyaty āyur balaṁ smṛtiḥ**

— *No translation provided*

**Key Insight: *Kali-yuga is characterized by a decline in dharma, memory, mercifulness, and physical strength.***

### 📖 Vedic Social Divisions

**Prabhupāda:** Formerly, there were divisions. **Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ** [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. The four social division: **brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra**. And they were calculated according to **guṇa** and **karma**, quality and work.

**Key Insight: *The Vedic social system is based on quality and work.***

### 📖 Qualities of a Brāhmaṇa

**Prabhupāda:** **Brāhmaṇa** means he must be truthful, he must be very clean, **satya śaucam**. He must be controlling his mind, controlling his senses, **śamo damas titikṣa**. He must be tolerant. **Titikṣa ārjava**. He must be simple. **Ārjava, jñānam**, he must have full knowledge; **vijñānam**, practical application in life. **Vijñānam āstikyam. Āstikyam** means to accept the Vedic principle as truth. That is called **āstikyam**. Theism. It is translated as "theism," but it is not **āstika**. **Āstikya** means to have firm faith in the Vedic instruction. That is called **āstikyam**.

**Key Insight: *A true brāhmaṇa possesses qualities like truthfulness, cleanliness, self-control, tolerance, simplicity, and faith in the Vedas.***

### 📖 The Power of Vedic Instruction

**Prabhupāda:** But that is a fact. What is stated in the **Vedas**, they are true. We can save our time. For example, just like the cow dung. The cow dung is said in the **Vedas** as pure. So if we accept cow dung as pure, we don't require to make research. But actually it is pure. The other day I was passing through a cowshed in Hyderabad. So, so much cow dung was stocked there. So I was asking my students, "Suppose so much human stool was stocked here. Could we pass through it?" No, it is not possible. But it was pleasant to pass through. So this is a fact. If we argue that animal stool... ...the animal stool is impure, but when the **Vedas** says the animal stool of the cow is pure, so this is, this true.

**Key Insight: *Vedic instructions are perfect and can be trusted, as seen in the example of cow dung being pure.***
