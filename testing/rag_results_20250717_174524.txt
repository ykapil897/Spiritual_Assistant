TEXT: Divine Grace. Furthermore, we are prepared to challenge the most erudite scholars of the Māyāvāda school and prove that the Personality of Godhead and His transcendental sports in Goloka alone constitute the sublime information of the //Vedas.// There are explicit indications of this in the //Chāndogya Upaniṣad// (8.13.1): > śyāmāc chavalaṁ prapadye > śavalāc chyāmaṁ prapadye "For receiving the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, I surrender unto His energy (Rādhā), and for receiving the mercy of His energy, I surrender unto Kṛṣṇa." Also in the //Ṛg Veda// (1.22.20): > //tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā > paśyanti sūrayaḥ divīva cakṣur ātatam > viṣṇor yat paramaṁ padam// "The lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu are the supreme objective of all the demigods. These lotus feet of the Lord are as enlightening as the sun in the sky." The plain truth so vividly explained in the //Gītā,// which is the central lesson of the //Vedas,// is not understood or even suspected by the most powerful scholars of the empiric schools. Herein lies the secret of Śrī Vyāsa-pūjā. When we meditate on the transcendental pastimes of the Absolute Godhead, we are proud to feel that we are His eternal servitors, and we become jubilant and dance with joy. All glory to my divine master, for it is he who has out of his unceasing flow of mercy stirred up within us such a movement of eternal existence. Let us bow down at his lotus feet. Gentlemen, had he not appeared before us to deliver us from the thralldom of this gross worldly delusion, surely we should have remained for lives and ages in the darkness of helpless captivity. Had he not appeared before us, we would not have been able to understand the eternal truth of the sublime teaching of Lord Caitanya. Had he not appeared before us, we could not have been able to know the significance of the first //śloka// of the //Brahma-saṁhitā:// > īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ > sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ > anādir ādir govindaḥ > sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam > [Bs. 5.1] "Kṛṣṇa, who is known as Govinda, is the Supreme Godhead. He has an eternal, blissful, spiritual body. He is the origin of all. He has no other origin, and He is the prime cause of all causes."

REFERENCE: chapter8 (Science of Self Realization)

TEXT: the impersonalist philosophy is incomplete and inferior. Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness recognize the pleasure potency in Kṛṣṇa and in all His paraphernalia---His friends, servants, father, mother, and consort. All relationships with Kṛṣṇa that aim at satisfying Kṛṣṇa's senses are manifestations of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. As far as the individual soul is concerned, it is originally a part and parcel of this pleasure potency, of the reservoir of pleasure Himself. However, due to contact with material nature, the soul has forgotten its actual position and has become trapped in the evolutionary process of transmigration from one body to another. Thus one struggles hard for existence. Now we must extricate ourselves from the sufferings of the struggle, from the countless transmigrations that force us to suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease, and death, and come to the point of our eternal life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That eternal life is possible. If one tries his best in this human form of life, in his next life he will get a spiritual body. The spiritual body is already within the gross material body, but it will develop only as soon as one becomes free from the contamination of this material existence. That is the aim of human life and the actual self-interest of all people. Self-interest is actually realizing, "I am part and parcel of God. I have to return to the kingdom of God and join with Him." Just as we have a social life here, God has a social life in the spiritual kingdom, and we can join Him there. It is not that after finishing this body we become void. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:2:12|(2.12)]] Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna, "Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings, nor in the future shall any of us cease to be." Our existence is therefore eternal, and the changes of birth and death are simply the changes of the temporary material bodies. The actual process for achieving eternal life is not at all difficult. This process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is based on knowledge received from Kṛṣṇa, the most perfect being. Knowledge received from others is defective because the conditioned soul is certain to commit mistakes, certain to be illusioned, certain to cheat, and certain to have imperfect senses.

REFERENCE: chapter5 (Science of Self Realization)

TEXT: then I am liberated. And that knowledge is called //brahma-bhūta [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]].// A person with this realization has no duty to perform. Because we are now identifying our existence with this material world, we have so many duties. The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// says that as long as there is no self-realization, we have so many duties and debts. We are indebted to the demigods. The demigods are not merely fictitious. They are real. There are demigods controlling the sun, the moon, and the air. Just as there are directors of government departments, so for the heating department there is the sun-god, for the air department there is Varuṇa, and similarly there are other departmental demigods. In the //Vedas// they are described as controlling deities, so we cannot neglect them. Also, there are great sages and philosophers who have given us knowledge, and we are indebted to them. So as soon as we take birth we are indebted to so many living entities, but it is impossible to liquidate all these debts. Therefore the Vedic literature recommends that one take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, "If one takes shelter of Me, then he doesn't have to take shelter of anyone else." Therefore those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, and the beginning is hearing and chanting. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. So our fervent, humble request to everyone is to please accept this chanting. This movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was introduced by Lord Caitanya five hundred years ago in Bengal, and now all over India and especially in Bengal there are millions of followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Now this movement is starting in the Western countries, so just be very serious in understanding it. We do not criticize any other religion. Don't take it in that way. We have no business criticizing any other process of religion. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is giving people the most sublime religion---love of God. That's all. We are teaching to love God. Everyone is already loving, but that love is misplaced. We love this boy or this girl or this country or that society or even the cats and dogs, but we are not satisfied. So we must place our love in God. If one places one's love in God, he will be happy.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.1.1**
"O my Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, son of Vasudeva, O all-pervading Personality of Godhead, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You."

**THE OFFENSE OF IMPERSONALISM**

In the realm of spiritual understanding, there exist two primary categories of philosophers: the personalists and the impersonalists. The personalists, or bhaktas, recognize the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, as the ultimate reality, while the impersonalists, or Māyāvādīs, deny His personal form and attributes. Unfortunately, the latter group commits a grave offense at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, as they fail to comprehend the sublime information of the Vedas.

**THE INCOMPLETENESS OF IMPERSONALISM**

As Śrīla Prabhupāda so eloquently states in the Science of Self Realization, Chapter 2, "The plain truth so vividly explained in the Gītā, which is the central lesson of the Vedas, is not understood or even suspected by the most powerful scholars of the empiric schools." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/2.txt/) This statement highlights the fundamental flaw in the impersonalist philosophy, which neglects the personal aspect of the Supreme Lord.

**THE PLEASURE POTENCY OF KṚṢṆA**

Furthermore, impersonalists fail to recognize the pleasure potency in Kṛṣṇa and His paraphernalia. As Śrīla Prabhupāda explains in the Science of Self Realization, Chapter 8, "Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness recognize the pleasure potency in Kṛṣṇa and in all His paraphernalia—His friends, servants, father, mother, and consort." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/8.txt/) This pleasure potency is the very essence of the Lord's transcendental sports in Goloka, which are beyond the comprehension of the impersonalists.

**THE INFERIORITY OF IMPERSONALISM**

The impersonalist philosophy is, therefore, incomplete and inferior. As Śrīla Prabhupāda states in the Science of Self Realization, Chapter 8, "The impersonalist philosophy is incomplete and inferior." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/8.txt/) This inferiority stems from their inability to recognize the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His transcendental nature.

**PRACTICAL APPLICATION**

As neophyte devotees, it is essential for us to understand the importance of recognizing the Personality of Godhead and His transcendental sports in Goloka. We must be cautious not to fall prey to the incomplete and inferior philosophy of impersonalism, which can lead to offenses at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. By embracing the teachings of Śrīla Prabhupāda and the Vedic scriptures, we can develop a deeper understanding of the Supreme Lord and His pleasure potency, ultimately leading us to the path of pure devotional service.

**CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, the offense of impersonalism is a grave mistake that can hinder our spiritual progress. By recognizing the Personality of Godhead and His transcendental sports in Goloka, we can avoid this offense and cultivate a deeper understanding of the sublime information of the Vedas. As Śrīla Prabhupāda so eloquently states, "The highest perfection of human life is to attain the spiritual platform and to render service to the Lord." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/8.txt/) Let us strive to attain this highest perfection by embracing the teachings of Śrīla Prabhupāda and the Vedic scriptures.
