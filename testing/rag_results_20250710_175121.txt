TEXT: of all incarnations. And it is not possible for any personality other than Kṛṣṇa Himself to deliver this benediction; therefore I say that You are Kṛṣṇa." //Kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne:// "You are Kṛṣṇa, but You have assumed the name Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. I surrender unto You." So this is the process. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and He is teaching how to develop love of God by a very simple method. He says simply to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. > harer nāma harer nāma > harer nāmaiva kevalam > kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva > nāsty eva gatir anyathā > [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]] "In this age, simply go on chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// There is no other alternative." People are embarrassed by so many methods of realization. They cannot take to the actual ritualistic processes of meditation or //yoga;// it is not possible. Therefore Lord Caitanya says that if one takes up this process of chanting, then immediately he can reach the platform of realization. The chanting process offered by Lord Caitanya for achieving love of God is called //saṅkīrtana. Saṅkīrtana// is a Sanskrit word. //Sam// means //samyak//---"complete." And //kīrtana// means "glorifying" or "describing." So complete description means complete glorification of the Supreme, or the Supreme Complete Whole. It is not that one can describe anything or glorify anything and that will be //kīrtana.// From the grammatical point of view that may be //kīrtana,// but according to the Vedic system, //kīrtana// means describing the supreme authority, the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is called //kīrtana.// This devotional service begins with the method of //śravaṇa. Śravaṇa// means "hearing," and //kīrtana// means "describing." One should describe, and another should hear. Or the same man himself can both describe and hear. He does not need anyone else's help. When we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, we chant and hear. This is complete. This is a complete method. But what is that chanting and hearing? One must chant and hear about Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. Not of anything else. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ:// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]] one can understand Viṣṇu, the all-pervading Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, by the method of hearing. We have to hear; if one simply hears, that is the beginning. One does not need any education or development of material knowledge. Just like a child: as soon as

TEXT: 1970 \\ J. F. Staal \\ Professor of Philosophy and of South Asian Languages \\ My dear Dr. Staal: I am very glad to receive your letter dated Sunday, February 8, 1970. I am very much pleased also to note the contents. Regarding convincing you that all scriptures prescribe chanting of the name of Kṛṣṇa, I can simply present the authority of Lord Caitanya. Lord Caitanya recommended, //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// ["Hari, Kṛṣṇa, is constantly to be praised" (//Śikṣāṣṭaka// 3) [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]]. Similarly, Madhvācārya quotes, //vede rāmāyaṇe caiva hariḥ sarvatra gīyate// ["Hari is sung about everywhere in the //Vedas// and //Rāmāyaṇa//"]. Similarly, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(15.15)]] the Lord says, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// ["By all the //Vedas,// I am to be known"]. In this way we find all the scriptures aiming at the Supreme Person. In the //Ṛg Veda// (1.22.20) the //mantra// is //oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ// ["The demigods are always looking to that supreme abode of Viṣṇu"]. The whole Vedic process, therefore, is to understand Lord Viṣṇu, and any scripture is directly or indirectly chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. Regarding the //Bhagavad-gītā,// verse 9.14, //kīrtayantaḥ// certainly means glorifying, chanting, reciting, and talking, as you have said; but glorifying, chanting, or reciting about whom? It is certainly Kṛṣṇa. The word used in this connection is //mām// ["Me"]. Therefore, we do not disagree when a person glorifies Kṛṣṇa, as Śukadeva did in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// This is also //kīrtana.// The highest among all Vedic literatures is the proper place for such glorification of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, and this is to be well understood from the verse: > nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ > śuka-mukhād amṛta-drava-saṁyutam > pibata bhāgavataṁ rasam ālayaṁ > muhur aho rasikā bhuvi bhāvukāḥ > [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]] **"O expert and thoughtful men, relish //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Therefore this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls."** [[books:sb:1:1:3|(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.1.3)]] It is said that Mahārāja Parīkṣit attained salvation simply by hearing, and similarly Śukadeva Gosvāmī attained salvation simply by chanting. In our devotional service there are nine different methods for achieving the same goal, love of Godhead, and the first process

TEXT: rich---everyone. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:5:18|(5.18)]]: > vidyā-vinaya-sampanne > brāhmaṇe ga vi hastini > śuni caiva śvapāke ca > paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ "The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle //brāhmaṇa,// a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater." **Ms. Nixon:** Could you explain the meaning of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra?// **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** It is very simple. //Hare// means, "O energy of the Lord," and //Kṛṣṇa// means, "O Lord Kṛṣṇa." Just as there are males and females in the material world, similarly, God is the original male (//puruṣa//), and His energy (//prakṛti//) is the original female. So, when we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, we are saying, "O Lord Kṛṣṇa, O energy of Kṛṣṇa, kindly engage me in Your service." **Ms. Nixon:** Could you please tell me a little bit about your life and how you knew that you were the spiritual master of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement? **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** My life is simple. I was a householder with a wife and children---now I have grandsons---when my spiritual master ordered me to go to the Western countries and preach the cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So I left everything on the order of my spiritual master, and now I am trying to execute his order and the orders of Kṛṣṇa. **Ms. Nixon:** How old were you when he told you to go to the West? **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** At our first meeting, he ordered me to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the West. I was then twenty-five years old, a married man with two children. I tried my best to carry out his orders and started managing //Back to Godhead// magazine in 1944, when I was still in household life. I started writing books in 1959 after retiring from family life, and in 1965 I came to the United States. **Ms. Nixon:** You have said that you are not God, and yet it appears to me, as an outsider, that your devotees treat you as if you were God. **Śrīla Prabhupāda:** Yes, that is their duty. Because the spiritual master is executing God's order, he should be respected as much as God, just as a government officer should be respected as much as the government because he executes the government's order. Even if an ordinary policeman comes, you have to

TEXT: or //Bhagavad-gītā// one becomes pious automatically. Therefore it is a rigid principle in every temple of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement that there must be a daily class for hearing and chanting. Our movement is meant for training spiritual leaders, but without hearing and chanting it is impossible to become a leader. Of course, in the material world it is possible, but not in the spiritual world. > mālī hañā sei bīja kare āropaṇa > śravaṇa-kīrtana jale karaye secana > [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]] Hearing and chanting waters the seed of devotional service, which develops one's original consciousness. So here, in these prayers, Kuntīdevī, a great devotee, is giving us an opportunity to become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by concentrating our mind on //paṅkaja,// the lotus flower. //Paṅka// means "mud," and //ja// means "generate." Although the lotus flower is generated from mud, it is a most important flower, and Kṛṣṇa likes it very much. Kuntīdevī therefore describes all the parts of Kṛṣṇa's body with reference to lotus flowers, so that as soon as one sees a lotus flower one will immediately think of Kṛṣṇa: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa's navel is just like a lotus, and from Kṛṣṇa's navel grew the stem of the lotus upon which Brahmā, the creator of this universe, was born. This universe includes so many planets, seas, mountains, and cities with motorcars and other paraphernalia, but the entire universe began from that lotus." //Namaḥ paṅkaja-māline// [[books:sb:1:8:22|[SB 1.8.22]]]. From Kṛṣṇa comes the wonderful lotus flower that contains the seed of the entire universe. But He is not the source of only one such flower. Kṛṣṇa is not so poor that He simply produces one lotus flower and then is finished. No. Just as there may be a garland with many flowers, Kṛṣṇa is the source of innumerable universes, which may be compared to a big garland of lotuses. This is God. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya/ jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// (Bs. 5.48). Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. We are very much concerned with this one planet, but Kṛṣṇa's creation contains an unlimited number of planets. We cannot count how many planets there are, any more than one can count how many hairs there are on one's head. This is the nature of Kṛṣṇa's creation. To give another example, on one tree there is an unlimited number of leaves. Similarly, there is an

TEXT: asked his wife, "What will make you comfortable?" A woman's nature, of course, is that she wants a good house, good food, fine garments, good children, and a good husband. These are a woman's ambitions. Thus Kardama Muni proved to her that she had received the best husband. By yogic powers he created for her this great airplane and gave her a big house with maidservants and all opulences. Kardama Muni was merely a human being, but he could perform such wonderful things by yogic powers. Kṛṣṇa, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers. If we get a little mystic power we become important, but Kṛṣṇa is the master of all mystic powers. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that wherever there is Yogeśvara, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all mystic powers, and wherever there is Arjuna, who is also known as Pārtha or Dhanur-dhara, everything is present. We should always remember that if we can keep ourselves always in company with Kṛṣṇa, we shall attain all perfection. And especially in this age, Kṛṣṇa has incarnated as the holy name (//kali-kāle nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa-avatāra,// Cc. //Ādi// 17.22). Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says: > nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis > tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ "My dear Lord, You are so kind that You are giving me Your association in the form of Your holy name, and this holy name can be chanted in any situation." There are no hard and fast rules for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. One can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa anywhere. Children, for example, also chant and dance. It is not at all difficult. While walking, our students take their beads with them and chant. Where is the loss? But the gain is very great, for by chanting we associate with Kṛṣṇa personally. Suppose we were to associate personally with the President. How proud we would feel. "Oh, I am with the President." So should we not feel very much proud if we were to associate with the supreme president, who is able to create many millions of presidents like those of this world? This chanting is our opportunity to do so. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi:// "My dear Lord, You are so kind to me that You are always prepared to give me Your association." //Durdaivam

You are the almighty God, and I offer You my respectful obeisances.**\\ [[books:sb:1:8:43|—Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.8.43]] A summary of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, is made herein by Śrīmatī Kuntīdevī. The almighty Lord has His eternal, transcendental abode, where He is engaged in keeping //surabhi// cows. He is served by hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune. He descends on the material world to reclaim His devotees and to annihilate the disturbing elements in groups of political parties and kings who are supposed to be in charge of administration work. He creates, maintains, and annihilates by His unlimited energies, and still He is always full with prowess and does not deteriorate in potency. The cows, the //brāhmaṇas,// and the devotees of the Lord are all objects of His special attention because they are very important factors for the general welfare of living beings. Kuntī addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as //kṛṣṇa-sakha// because she knows that although Arjuna, who is also known as Kṛṣṇa, is her son and therefore subordinate to her, Lord Kṛṣṇa is more intimately related with Arjuna than with her. Kṛṣṇā is also a name of Draupadī, and so the word //kṛṣṇa-sakha// also indicates Lord Kṛṣṇa's relationship with Draupadī, whom He saved from being insulted when Duryodhana and Karṇa attempted to strip her naked. Kuntī also addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as //vṛṣṇi-ṛṣabha,// the child of the dynasty of Vṛṣṇi. It was because Kṛṣṇa appeared in the Vṛṣṇi dynasty that this dynasty became famous, just as Malaysia and the Malaya Hills became famous because of the sandalwood that grows there. Kuntīdevī also addresses Lord Kṛṣṇa as the destroyer of the political parties or royal dynasties that disturb the earth. In every monarchy, the king is honored very gorgeously. Why? Since he is a human being and the other citizens are also human beings, why is

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🕉 Glorifying the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa: The Ultimate Goal of Devotion

My dear devotee, let us take a moment to reflect on the importance of glorifying the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, as taught by Srila Prabhupada. In Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.5.23-24, we find a beautiful description of the various ways to glorify the Lord: *"Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam..."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/sb/7/5.txt). This verse highlights the importance of hearing, chanting, remembering, and serving the Lord's lotus feet.

✨ Understanding Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead

To truly glorify the Lord, we must first understand His supreme position. As stated in Caitanya-caritāmṛta Ādi 17.21, *"In this age, simply go on chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. There is no other alternative."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/cc/adi/17.txt). This emphasizes the importance of chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa as a means to connect with Him.

✨ The Whole Vedic Process: Understanding Lord Viṣṇu

The entire Vedic process is aimed at understanding Lord Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. As Srila Prabhupada writes in his letter to Dr. Staal, *"In the Bhagavad-gītā (15.15) the Lord says, 'vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ' ['By all the Vedas, I am to be known']. In this way we find all the scriptures aiming at the Supreme Person."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/ssr/3.txt). This highlights the ultimate goal of Vedic knowledge: to understand and glorify the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa.

✨ Kṛṣṇa: The Source of Innumerable Universes

Kṛṣṇa is not only the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also the source of innumerable universes. As Srila Prabhupada explains in Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 5, *"Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. We are very much concerned with this one planet, but Kṛṣṇa's creation contains an unlimited number of planets."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/5.txt). This understanding helps us appreciate the magnitude of Kṛṣṇa's power and glory.

✨ Kṛṣṇa: The Master of All Mystic Powers

Furthermore, Kṛṣṇa is the master of all mystic powers, as described in Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 13: *"Kṛṣṇa, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers."* [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/13.txt). This understanding helps us recognize Kṛṣṇa's supreme position and the futility of trying to attain spiritual perfection through our own limited efforts.

✨ Practical Application: Glorifying Kṛṣṇa in Our Daily Lives

So, how can we apply this understanding in our daily lives? By regularly chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa, reading about His glories in scriptures, and serving His devotees, we can cultivate a deeper appreciation for the Supreme Lord. Let us strive to glorify Kṛṣṇa in every aspect of our lives, recognizing His supreme position as the source of all creation and the master of all mystic powers.

May we always remember the importance of glorifying the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, and may our lives be filled with devotion, love, and service to Him.
