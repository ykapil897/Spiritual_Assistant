    "text": "The aim of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to bring all living entities back to their original consciousness. All living entities within the material world are, to varying degrees, afflicted with a type of madness. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement aims at curing man of his material disease and reestablishing his original consciousness. In a Bengali poem a great Vaiṣṇava poet has written, \"When a man is haunted by ghosts, he can only speak nonsense. Similarly, anyone who is under the influence of material nature should be considered haunted, and whatever he speaks should be considered nonsense.\" One may be considered a great philosopher or great scientist, but if he is haunted by the ghost of //māyā,// illusion, whatever he theorizes and whatever he speaks is more or less nonsensical. Today we are given the example of a psychiatrist who, when requested to examine a murderer, proclaimed that since all the patients with whom he had come in contact were more or less crazy, the court could excuse the murderer on those grounds if it so desired. The point is that in the material world it is very difficult to find a sane living entity. The prevailing atmosphere of insanity in this world is all caused by the infection of material consciousness. The purpose of this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is to bring man back to his original consciousness, which is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, clear consciousness. When water falls from the clouds, it is uncontaminated like distilled water, but as soon as it touches the ground it becomes muddy and discolored. Similarly, we are originally pure spirit soul, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore our original constitutional position is as pure as God's. In //Bhagavad-gītā// Sri Kṛṣṇa says: > mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke > jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ > manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi > prakṛti-sthāni karṣati **\"The living entities in this conditional world are My fragmental parts, and they are eternal. But due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.\"** [[books:bg:15:7|(Bg. 15.7)]] Thus all living entities are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. By Kṛṣṇa it should always be remembered that we are speaking of God, Kṛṣṇa denoting the all-attractive Supreme Personality of Godhead. As a fragment of gold is qualitatively the same as a gold reservoir, so the minute particles of Kṛṣṇa's body",

    "text": "are therefore qualitatively as good as Kṛṣṇa. The chemical composition of God's body and the eternal spiritual body of the living entity is the same-spiritual. Thus originally, in our uncontaminated condition, we possessed a form as good as God's, but just as rain falls to the ground, so we come in contact with this material world, which is manipulated by the external material energy of Kṛṣṇa. When we speak of external energy or material nature, the question may be raised, \"Whose energy? Whose nature?\" Material energy or nature is not active independently. Such a concept is foolish. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is clearly stated that material nature does not work independently. When a foolish man sees a machine he may think that it is working automatically, but actually it is not---there is a driver, someone in control, although we sometimes cannot see the controller behind the machine due to our defective vision. There are many electronic mechanisms which work very wonderfully, but behind these intricate systems there is a scientist who pushes the button. This is very simple to understand: since a machine is matter, it cannot work on its own accord but must work under spiritual direction. A tape recorder works, but it works according to the plans and under the direction of a living entity, a human being. The machine is complete, but unless it is manipulated by a spirit soul, it cannot work. Similarly, we should understand that this cosmic manifestation which we call nature is a great machine and that behind this machine there is God, Kṛṣṇa. This is also affirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// where Kṛṣṇa says: > mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ > sūyate sa-carācaram > hetunānena kaunteya > jagad viparivartate **\"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, producing all the moving and unmoving beings, and by its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again.\"** [[books:bg:9:10|(Bg. 9.10)]] There are two kinds of entities---the moving (such as human beings, animals and insects) and nonmoving (such as trees and mountains). Kṛṣṇa says that material nature, which controls both kinds of entities, is acting under His direction. Thus behind everything there is a supreme controller. Modern civilization does not understand this due to lack of knowledge; it is the purpose of this Society for Kṛṣṇa consciousness therefore to enlighten",

There are many universities, especially in the United States, and many departments of knowledge, but they are not discussing these points. Where is the department for this knowledge that we find given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā?// When I spoke before students and some faculty members at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the first question raised was: \"Where is the technological department which is investigating the difference between a dead man and a living man?\" When a man dies, something is lost. Where is the technology to replace it? Why don't scientists try to solve this problem? Because this is a very difficult subject matter, they set it aside and busily engage in the technology of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. However, Vedic literatures inform us that this is animal technology. Animals are also trying their best to eat well, to have an enjoyable sex life, to sleep peacefully, and to defend themselves. What then is the difference between man's knowledge and animal's knowledge? The fact is that man's knowledge should be developed to explore that difference between a living man and a dead man, a living body and a dead body. That spiritual knowledge was imparted by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna in the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Being a friend of Kṛṣṇa's, Arjuna was a very intelligent man, but his knowledge, as all men's, was limited. Kṛṣṇa spoke, however, of subject matters which were beyond Arjuna's finite knowledge. These subjects are called //adhokṣaja// because our direct perception by which we acquire material knowledge fails to approach them. For example, we have many powerful microscopes to see what we cannot see with our limited vision, but there is no microscope that can show us the soul within the body. Nevertheless, the soul is there. //Bhagavad-gītā// informs us that in this body there is a proprietor. I am the proprietor, and others are the proprietors of their bodies. I say, \"My hand,\" but not \"I hand.\" Since it is \"my hand,\" I am different from the hand, being its owner. Similarly, we speak of \"My eye,\" \"My leg,\" \"My this,\" \"My that.\" In the midst of all of",

What am I?\" We cannot find the answers to these questions by any material effort, and because of this all the universities are setting these questions aside. They say, \"It is too difficult a subject.\" Or they brush it aside: \"It is irrelevant.\" Thus engineers direct their attention to creating and attempting to perfect the horseless carriage and wingless bird. Formerly, horses were drawing carriages and there was no air pollution, but now there are cars and rockets, and the scientists are very proud. \"We have invented horseless carriages and wingless birds,\" they boast. Although they invent imitation wings for the airplane or rocket, they cannot invent a soulless body. When they are able to actually do this, they will deserve credit. But such an attempt would necessarily be frustrated, for we know that there is no machine that can work without a spirit soul behind it. Even the most complicated computers need trained men to handle them. Similarly, we should know that this great machine, which is known as the cosmic manifestation, is manipulated by a supreme spirit. That is Kṛṣṇa. Scientists are searching for the ultimate cause or the ultimate controller of this material universe and are postulating different theories and proposals, but the real means for knowledge is very easy and perfect: we need only hear from the perfect person, Kṛṣṇa. By accepting the knowledge imparted in //Bhagavad-gītā,// anyone can immediately know that this great cosmic machine, of which the earth is a part, is working so wonderfully because there is a driver behind it---Kṛṣṇa. Our process of knowledge is very easy. Kṛṣṇa's instruction, //Bhagavad-gītā,// is the principal book of knowledge given by the //ādi-puruṣa// Himself, the Supreme primeval person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is indeed the perfect person. It may be argued that although we have accepted Him as a perfect person, there are many others who do not. Rut one should not think that this acceptance is whimsical; He is accepted as the perfect person on the evidence of many authorities. We do not accept Kṛṣṇa as perfect simply on the basis of our whims or sentiments.",

The treasure house of knowledge is contained in the //Vedas,// and their author, Vyāsadeva, accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Vyāsadeva's spiritual master, Nārada, also accepts Kṛṣṇa as such. Nārada's spiritual master, Brahmā, accepts Kṛṣṇa not only as the Supreme person but the supreme controller as well---//īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ:// [Bs. 5.1] \"The supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa.\" There is no one in the creation who can claim that he is not controlled. Everyone, regardless of how important or powerful, has a controller over his head. Kṛṣṇa, however, has no controller; therefore He is God. He is the controller of everyone, but there is no one superior to Him, no one to control Him; nor is there anyone equal to Him, no one to share His platform of absolute control. This may sound very strange, for there are many so-called gods nowadays. Indeed, gods have become very cheap, being especially imported from India. People in other countries are fortunate that gods are not manufactured there, but in India gods are manufactured practically every day. We often hear that God is coming to Los Angeles or New York and that people are gathering to receive Him, etc. But Kṛṣṇa is not the type of God manufactured in a mystic factory. No. He was not //made// God, but He //is// God. We should know then on the basis of authority that behind this gigantic material nature, the cosmic manifestation, there is God---Kṛṣṇa---and that He is accepted by all Vedic authorities. Acceptance of authority is not new for us; everyone accepts authority in some form or another. For education we go to a teacher or to a school or simply learn from our father and mother. They are all authorities, and our nature is to learn from them. In our childhood we asked, \"Father, what is this?\" and father would say, \"This is a pen,\" \"These are spectacles,\" or \"This is a table.\" In this way from the very beginnings of life a child learns from his father and mother. He learns the names of things and the basic relations of one thing to another by questioning his parents. A good father and mother never cheat when their son",

Similarly, if we get spiritual information from an authority and if the authority is not a cheater, then our knowledge is perfect. If we attempt to reach conclusions by dint of our own speculative powers, however, we are subject to fall into error. The process of induction, by which, reasoning from particular facts or individual cases, one can arrive at a general conclusion, is never a perfect process. Because we are limited and our experience is limited, it will always remain imperfect. If we receive information from the perfect source, Kṛṣṇa, and if we repeat that information, then what we are speaking can also be accepted as perfect and authoritative. The process of //paramparā// or disciplic succession is this very process of hearing from Kṛṣṇa or from authorities who have accepted Kṛṣṇa and repeating exactly what they have said. In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa recommends this process of knowledge: > evam paramparā-prāptam > imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ **\"This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way.\"** [[books:bg:4:2|(Bg. 4.2)]] Formerly knowledge was passed down by great saintly kings who were the authorities. In previous ages, however, these kings were //ṛṣis//---great learned scholars and devotees---and because they were not ordinary men the government which they headed worked very nicely. There are many instances in Vedic civilization of kings who attained perfection as devotees of God. For example, Dhruva Mahārāja went to the forest to search out God and by practice of severe penance and austerity found God within six months. Although he was only a five-year-old prince with a very delicate body, he was successful because he followed the directions of his spiritual master, Nārada. The first month Dhruva Mahārāja was in the forest, he simply ate some fruits and vegetables once every three days and drank a little water every six days. He finally restricted his inhalation of air and stood for six months on one leg only. After he executed these severe austerities for half a year, God became manifest before him, eye to eye. It is not necessary for us to practice such severe austerities, but simply by following in the footsteps of Vedic authorities we also can see God eye to eye. This vision",

There are restrictions governing eating and sex life (only //prasādam,// food first offered to Kṛṣṇa, is taken, and sex is restricted to married life), and there are other regulations which facilitate and foster spiritual realization. It is not possible in these days to imitate Dhruva Mahārāja, but by following certain basic Vedic principles, we can make advancement in spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As we advance, we become perfect in knowledge. What is the use in becoming a scientist or a philosopher if we cannot say what our next life will be? A realized student of Kṛṣṇa consciousness can very easily say what his next life is, what God is, what the living entity is and what his relationship with God is. His knowledge is perfect because it is coming from perfect books of knowledge such as //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// This then is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is very easy, and anyone can adopt it and make his life perfect. If someone says, \"I'm not educated at all, and I cannot read books,\" he is still not disqualified. He can still perfect his life by simply chanting the //mahā-mantra:// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

By hearing His message, we learn to control the tongue, and after the tongue is controlled, the other senses follow. Of all the senses, the tongue is the most voracious and difficult to control, but it can be controlled simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and tasting Kṛṣṇa //prasādam,// food offered to Kṛṣṇa. We cannot understand Kṛṣṇa by sensual perception or by speculation. It is not possible, for Kṛṣṇa is so great that He is beyond our sensual range. But He can be understood by surrender.

This subject was discussed by Mahārāja Parīkṣit and Śukadeva Gosvāmī, who noted that a //brāhmaṇa,// who was very fallen and addicted to all kinds of sinful activities, was saved simply by chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa. This is found in the Sixth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// an epic work by Vyāsadeva describing the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa and elaborating on the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the Fifth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the universal planetary systems are very fully explained. Within the universe there are lower, middle and higher planetary systems. Actually, not only the //Bhāgavatam// but all religious scriptures contain descriptions of hellish or lower planetary systems and heavenly or higher systems. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// gives evidence of where these planets are and indicates how far they are from this planet, just as astronomers have calculated how far the moon and other heavenly bodies are from earth. Similarly, the //Bhāgavatam// contains descriptions of the various planets. Even on this planet we experience different climatic conditions. In temperate countries such as the United States, the climate is different from that of a tropical country like India. just as there are environmental differences on this planet, there are other planets which have far different atmospheres and environments. After hearing a description of such planets from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Parīkṣit Mahārāja said: > adhuneha mahā-bhāga yathaiva narakān naraḥ > nānogra-yātanān neyāt tan me vyākhyātum arhasi **\"Sir, I have heard from you about the hellish planets. Men who are very sinful are sent to those planets.\"** [[books:sb:6:1:6|(Bhāg. 6.1.6)]] Parīkṣit Mahārāja was a Vaiṣṇava (devotee), and a Vaiṣṇava always feels compassion for others’ distress. For instance, when Lord Jesus Christ appeared, he was greatly aggrieved by the miserable conditions of the people. Regardless of the country or sect to which they belong, all Vaiṣṇavas or devotees---any people who are God conscious or Kṛṣṇa conscious---are thus compassionate. Therefore to blaspheme a Vaiṣṇava, a preacher of God’s glories, is a great offense. Kṛṣṇa never tolerates offenses committed at the lotus feet of a pure Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava, however, is always ready to forgive such offenses. //Kṛpāmbudhi:// A Vaiṣṇava is an ocean of mercy. //Vāñcā-kalpa-taru:// Everyone has desires, but a Vaiṣṇava can fulfill all desires. //Kalpa-taru// refers to a tree in",

That is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā (cintāmaṇi prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa).// A pure Vaiṣṇava is compared to such a wish-fulfilling tree, for he can bestow a matchless gift upon a sincere disciple---Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A Vaiṣṇava is addressed as //mahā-bhāga,// which means \"fortunate.\" One who becomes a Vaiṣṇava and is God conscious is understood to be greatly fortunate. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the chief exponent of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this age, has explained that the living entities in various planetary systems all over the universe are rotating in different species of life. A living entity can go wherever he likes---to heaven or to hell---simply by preparing himself for either place. There are many heavenly planets, many hellish planets, and many species of life. //Padma Purāṇa// estimates the species of life to be 8,400,000, and the living entity is rotating or wandering through these species and creating bodies according to his mentality in his present life. \"As you sow, so shall you reap,\" is the law that governs here. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that out of these numberless living entities who are transmigrating in the material world, one may be fortunate enough to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is being distributed freely everywhere, yet not everyone takes to it, especially in this age of Kali. Because of this, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// characterizes people in the age of Kali as unfortunate. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that only those who are fortunate take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thus attain a pleasant and blissful life of knowledge. It is the duty of a Vaiṣṇava to go from door to door to try to get unfortunate people to accept good fortune. A Vaiṣṇava thinks, \"How can these people be delivered from their hellish life?\" That was also Mahārāja Parīkṣit’s inquiry. \"Sir,\" he said, \"you have described that because of one’s sinful activities he is put into a hellish condition of life or in a hellish planetary system.

They often think, \"If I go to preach and associate with other, I may fall down, and my realization will be finished.\" Therefore they do not come forward to preach. Only the Vaiṣṇavas come, even at the risk of falldown---but they do not fall down. A Vaiṣṇava is even willing to go to hell to deliver conditioned souls. This is also Prahlāda Mahārāja’s mission.

I have no anxiety for myself because somehow or other I have been trained to be Kṛṣṇa conscious always.\" Because Prahlāda was Kṛṣṇa conscious, he was confident that in his next life he was going to Kṛṣṇa. It is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// that if one executes the regulated principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness carefully, it is certain that he will reach the supreme destination in his next life. Prahlāda Mahārāja continues: \"There is only one source of anxiety for me. I am anxious for those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious. For myself I have no anxiety, but I am thinking of them.\" And why aren’t people Kṛṣṇa conscious? //Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān.// The rascals have created a humbug civilization for temporary happiness. //Māyā-sukhāya.// Actually this is a fact.

Māyā// means false, illusory. We try to create a very comfortable situation, but we only succeed in creating another uncomfortable situation. This is the way of the material world; if we are not satisfied by the natural comforts offered by God and nature, and we want to create artificial comforts, then we have to create discomfort also. Most people, ignorant of this fact, think that they are creating a very comfortable situation, but in actuality they end up traveling fifty miles to go to the office to earn a livelihood and fifty miles to come back. Due to such conditions, Prahlāda Mahārāja says that these //vimūḍhas,// materialistic persons, have unnecessarily burdened themselves simply for temporary happiness. //Vimūḍhān, māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato.// Therefore in Vedic civilization it is recommended that one free himself from material life, take //sannyāsa,// the renounced order, and execute devotional service with no anxiety.

The Gosvāmīs, the chief disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, were such Vaiṣṇavas, and were thus described by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya: > nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau > lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tribhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau > rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena mattālikau > vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau **\"The six Gosvāmīs---Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrī Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Śrī Raghunātha Dāsa Gosvāmī, Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī and Śrī Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī---are very expert in scrutinizingly studying all the revealed scriptures with the purpose of establishing eternal religious principles for the benefit of all human beings. They are always absorbed in the mood of the gopīs and are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.\"** With similar Vaiṣṇava compassion, Parīkṣit Mahārāja told Śukadeva Gosvāmī: \"You have just described the different types of hellish life. Now, tell me how those who are suffering can be delivered. Kindly explain this to me.\" //Adhuneha mahā-bhāga yathaiva narakān naraḥ nānogra-yātanān neyāt tan me.// The word //naraḥ// refers to human beings, or those who are fallen. //Narakān naraḥ nānogra-yātanān neyāt tan me:// \"How can they be delivered from their fierce miseries and horrible pains?\" That is typical of a Vaiṣṇava heart. Mahārāja Parīkṣit also said, \"Somehow or other they have fallen down to a hellish life, but that does not mean that they should remain in that condition. There must be some means by which they can be delivered, so kindly explain those means.\" Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied: > na ced ihaivāpacitiṁ yathāṁhasaḥ > kṛtasya kuryān mana-ukti-pāṇibhiḥ > dhruvaṁ sa vai pretya narakān upaiti > ye kīrtitā me bhavatas tigma-yātanāḥ **\"Yes, I have already described various hellish conditions typical of a severe and painful life. The point is that one has to counteract such a life.\"** [[books:sb:6:1:7|(Bhāg. 6.1.7)]] How can this be done? There are various ways in which sinful activities can be committed. One is by the mind. If a person thinks of committing some sinful activity and thus makes a plan---\"I shall kill that man\"---that is also considered to be sinful. When the mind is thinking, feeling and willing, then there is action. In certain areas of the United States, a dog owner is responsible",

The dog is not responsible because it is an animal, but because the owner of the animal has made the dog his best friend, he is responsible by law. Similarly, just as the barking of a dog may be considered unlawful, offensive speech may also be considered sinful, for it is just like barking. The point is that sinful activities can be committed in so many ways---one may think of them, or one may speak sinfully, or one may actually commit a sin. In any case, they are all considered sinful activities. //Dhruvaṁ// sa //vai pretya narakān upaiti:// One has to suffer punishment for such activities. People do not believe in a next life because they want to avoid botheration and punishment, but the next life cannot be avoided. It is a well known fact that we must act according to law, or we will be punished. If one commits criminal activities, the state will punish him. Sometimes, however, a criminal may escape punishment by the state, but this is not the case with God’s law. One can cheat others, commit theft and hide, thereby saving himself from the punishment of the state, but one cannot save himself from the superior law, the law of nature. It is very difficult because there are many witnesses: the daylight is witness, the moonlight is witness, and Kṛṣṇa is the supreme witness. Thus one cannot say, \"I am committing this sin, but no one can see me.\" Kṛṣṇa is the supreme witness sitting within the heart, and He not only notes what one is thinking and doing, but He also gives the living entity facility. If one wants to do something in order to satisfy his senses, Kṛṣṇa gives all facility. This is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā. Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ:// \"I am sitting in everyone’s heart.\" //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:// \"From Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.\" In this way Kṛṣṇa gives us a chance.

If we think that we can be happy without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Kṛṣṇa does not object to that. //Yathecchasi tathā kuru.// After advising Arjuna, He simply said, \"Now I have explained everything to you. Whatever you desire, you can do.\" Arjuna replied immediately, //kariṣye vacanaṁ tava://\"Now I shall execute Your order.\" That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. God does not interfere with our tiny independence. If we want to act according to the order of God, then He will help us. Even if one falls down sometimes, if one becomes sincere, thinking, \"From this time I shall remain Kṛṣṇa conscious and execute His orders,\" then Kṛṣṇa will help him. In all respects, even if one falls down, he will be excused and given more intelligence. This intelligence will say, \"Don’t do this. Now go on with your duty.\" But if one wants to forget Kṛṣṇa, if he wants to become happy without Kṛṣṇa, the Lord will give so many chances to enable him to forget Him life after life. Parīkṣit Mahārāja said: \"It is not that if I say there is no God that there will be no God or that I will not be responsible for what I do.\" The atheists deny God due to their sinful activities. If they thought that there were a God, they would shudder at the thought of punishment; therefore they deny His existence. When rabbits are attacked by larger animals, they close their eyes and think, \"I am not going to be killed,\" but they are killed anyway. Similarly, we may deny the existence of God and His laws, but still God and His laws are there. In the high court, one may say, \"I don’t care for the law of the government,\" but he will be forced to accept the government law. If one denies the state law, he will be put into prison and duly punished. Similarly, one may foolishly decry the existence of God by various means (\"There is no God,\" or \"I am God\"), but ultimately one is responsible for all his actions, both good and bad.

There are different types of atonement. If a person commits a sin and counteracts it by penance, that is atonement. There are examples of this in the Christian Bible. Śukadeva says that one has to execute the prescribed atonement according to the gravity of his sinful activities. A physician may prescribe an expensive medicine or a cheap medicine according to the gravity of the disease. For a headache, he may simply prescribe an aspirin, but if there is some severe illness he may prescribe a surgical operation which will cost thousands of dollars. Similarly, sinful activities are diseases, so one should follow the prescribed cures to become healthy. By accepting the chain of birth and death, the soul accepts a diseased condition. The soul is not subject to birth, death or disease because it is pure spirit. In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa says that a soul has no birth //(na jāyate)// and that it has no death (mriyate). > na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin > nāyaṁ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ > ajo nityaḥ śāśvato ’yaṁ purāṇo > na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre **\"For the soul there is never birth or death.

A living entity may have an abundant supply of food for eating, or many nice buildings for sleeping, or good arrangements for sex life, or a good defense to protect him, but this does not mean that he is a human being. A civilization which is based on these activities should be known to be animalistic. Since animals are also interested in these functions, what is the difference between human life and animal life if a human being does not go beyond them? The distinction can be made when a human being becomes inquisitive and asks, \"Why have I been put into this miserable condition? Is there any remedy for it? is there perpetual eternal life? I do not want to die, nor do I want to suffer. I want to live very happily and peacefully. Is there a chance for this? What is the method or science by which this can be achieved?\" When these questions are asked, and steps are taken to answer them, our human civilization is the result. If the questions never arise, then that civilization should be known as animalistic. Animals and animalistic human beings are simply interested in continuing the process of eating, sleeping, mating and defending, but in actuality this process is forced to break down. The fact is that there is no real defense because no one can protect himself from the hands of cruel death. For instance, Hiraṇyakaśipu, who wanted to live forever, underwent severe austerities, but he was foiled in the end by the Lord Himself in the form of a lion-man, Nṛsiṁhadeva, who killed Hiraṇyakaśipu with His claws. So-called scientists are now claiming that some time in the future we shall stop death by scientific methods, but this is simply another crazy utterance. Stopping death is not at all possible.

    "text": "Contamination from sinful activity requires proportionate atonement. That is the prescription of the scriptures. Śukadeva Gosvāmī says that if one accepts atonement before death, in his next life he will not fall down. If he does not atone, he will carry with him the resultant reactions of his sinful activities and will have to suffer. According to law, if a man kills someone he must himself be killed. The idea of a life for a life is not a very new concept but can be found in the //Manu-saṁhitā,// the Vedic lawbook for mankind, where it is stated that when a king hangs the murderer, the murderer is actually benefited, for if he is not killed, he will carry the reaction for his murder and will have to suffer in so many ways. The laws of nature are very subtle and are very diligently administered, although people do not know it. In the //Manu-saṁhitā// the concept of a life for a life is sanctioned, and it is actually observed throughout the world. Similarly, there are other laws which state that one cannot even kill an ant without being responsible. Since we cannot create, we have no right to kill any living entity, and therefore man-made laws that distinguish between killing a man and killing an animal are imperfect. Although there are imperfections in man-made laws, there cannot be defects in the laws of God. According to the laws of God, killing an animal is as punishable as killing a man. Those who draw distinctions between the two are concocting their own laws. Even in the Ten Commandments it is prescribed, \"Thou shall not kill.\" This is a perfect law, but by discriminating and speculating men distort it. \"I shall not kill man, but I shall kill animals.\" In this way people cheat themselves and inflict suffering on themselves and others. In any case, however, God’s laws will not excuse such behavior. Everyone is God’s creature, although in different bodies or dresses. God is considered the one supreme father. A father may have many children, and some may be intelligent and others not very intelligent, but if an intelligent son tells his father, \"My brother is not very intelligent; let me kill him,\" will the father agree? Simply because one son is not very intelligent",

Similarly, if God is the supreme father, why should He sanction the killing of animals who are also His sons? In //Bhagavad-gītā// God declares to Arjuna that all 8,400,000 species of living entities are His sons. \"And I am their seed giving father,\" the Lord says. just as in ordinary material procreation the father gives the seed and the mother develops the body by supplying the necessary blood to the embryo, similarly, the living entities, parts and parcels of the supreme father, are impregnated by the Lord in material nature. The dimension of the spirit soul is very minute and is given in the scriptures as //keśāgra//---one ten thousandth the portion of the tip of a hair. We can hardly imagine a very small point divided into thousands of parts. In other words, it is so minute that it cannot be perceived even by the most powerful microscope. Thus the dimension of the spiritual spark is so minute that it is invisible to mundane vision. All of this information is given in the scriptures, but because we do not have the proper vision, we cannot see. Although our material eyes cannot perceive the dimension of the soul, the soul is nonetheless within the body, and as soon as it departs, it takes another body according to its work. One should always consider that behind all these activities is superior superintendence. The living entity works in the material world just as the office worker works at his job, and a service record is kept of his performance. The living entity does not know what the opinion of his superior is, but his service record is kept in the office nonetheless, and according to his activities he is awarded promotion or increment of pay, or sometimes he may be demoted or even fired. Similarly, for all our activities there are witnesses; therefore it is said in the scriptures that the living entities are under superior supervision and that they are rewarded and punished according to their work.

    "text": "superiors. Generally the living entity does not know the science of how the spirit soul transmigrates from one body to another. The spirit soul transmigrates even in the duration of one life as the body changes. When the body is first manifest in the womb of the mother, it is very small, just like a pea, and it gradually develops nine holes---two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, one genital, and one rectum. In this way the body develops, and as long as it needs to develop within the mother’s womb, it remains there. When it is sufficiently developed to go outside, it comes out and grows. Growth entails changing of the body. This change cannot be understood because it is imperceivable to the living entity. In childhood we had small bodies which now no longer exist; therefore it can be said that we have changed our bodies. Similarly, because of the nature of material things, we have to change this body when it ceases to work. Every material thing deteriorates, and like a broken machine or an old piece of cloth the body becomes useless after a certain length of time. Although this process of growth is always taking place, the educational system in modern universities, though considered advanced, unfortunately does not deal with this. Actually there is no education without spiritual knowledge. One can learn to earn bread, eat, sleep and mate without a formal education. Animals are not educated---they are not technicians, and they have no university degrees---but they are also eating, sleeping, mating and defending. If the educational system simply teaches these processes, it does not deserve the name of education. Real education enables us to understand what we are. As long as man does not develop his consciousness by understanding the truth of the self, all of his actions will be performed in the mode of ignorance. A human life is meant for victory over the laws of material nature. Actually, we are all trying to attain that victory in order to counteract the onslaught of material nature. The ultimate victory is to conquer birth, death, disease and old age, but we have neglected this important point.

In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is stated, //jīvo jīvasya jīvanam:// \"One living entity is food for another.\" //(Bhāg.// 1.13.47) Animals without hands are food for animals with hands, such as ourselves. Animals with no legs are food for animals with four legs. Grass is a living entity, but it has no legs with which to move, and thus it is eaten by cows and other animals. Such nonmoving entities are food for moving animals, and in this way the world is in a constant struggle between exploiters and exploited. The weaker is exploited by the stronger; this is nature’s law. Traditionally, Vaiṣṇavas, or devotees of Kṛṣṇa, do not eat meat. This is not just for the sake of vegetarianism, but for the furtherance of God consciousness. In order to become God conscious, one must follow some rules and regulations. Of course one has to eat, but the proposal is that one should eat remnants of foodstuffs that are offered to Kṛṣṇa. This is also the philosophy of //Bhagavad-gītā,// wherein Kṛṣṇa says: > patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ > yo me bhaktyā prayacchati > tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam > aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ \"If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.\" [[books:bg:9:26|(Bg. 9.26)]] It is not that Kṛṣṇa is hungry and is begging food from us. The purpose of this offering is to create a loving transaction. Kṛṣṇa wants this transaction: \"You love Me, and I’ll love you.\" As God, Kṛṣṇa’s energy creates and sustains everything, so why should he beg a leaf, a fruit and a little water from us? He will be very pleased, however, if we offer him a piece of fruit, a leaf and water with love, saying, \"Kṛṣṇa, I am so poor that I cannot secure anything. I have secured this fruit and a leaf. Kindly accept them.\" Such an offering would make Kṛṣṇa very glad. If He eats what we offer, our life will be successful, for we will actually make friends with Kṛṣṇa. Fruit, flowers and water can be secured practically in any part of the world by any man, poor or rich, and can be offered. We should remember then that it is not vegetarianism which is important,",

We give something to our lover, he gives something to us, and in this way love develops. When we create any loving transaction with any boy or girl, man or woman, we give and take. Thus Kṛṣṇa is teaching us how to give and take. Kṛṣṇa is begging us: \"Try to love Me. Learn how to love Me. Offer something to Me.\" \"Sir,\" we may say, \"I have nothing to give You.\" \"Oh, you cannot collect a piece of fruit, a flower, a leaf or a little water?\" \"Oh yes, why not? Anyone can collect this.\" This then is the method of Kṛṣṇa consciousness which allows one to make friends with Kṛṣṇa. We can enter into any number of relationships with Kṛṣṇa. We can become a direct servant of Kṛṣṇa, or in the highest stages we can become Kṛṣṇa’s father, mother or lover. Kṛṣṇa is prepared to establish a loving relationship with all living entities. In actuality this relationship is already there because He is the supreme father and we are His parts and parcels. Because the son is part of the body of the father, the relationship between them cannot be broken; it may be forgotten for some time, but as soon as one recognizes his father or son, immediately affection develops. Similarly, we are eternally related to Kṛṣṇa, but at the present moment this relationship is simply forgotten or suppressed. Consequently, we think that we have no relationship with Kṛṣṇa, but this is not a fact. Because we are integral with Him, because we are part and parcel of Him, our relationship with Him is eternal. That relationship simply has to be revived, and that revival is this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. At present we are under the sway of a different consciousness. One person is thinking that he is Indian, another is thinking that he is American, and someone else is thinking, \"I am this,\" or \"I am that.\" In this way we create so many artificial identities, but our actual identity should be, \"I am Kṛṣṇa’s.\" When we think in this way, we are thinking in Kṛṣṇa",

Kṛṣṇa is related to everyone as eternal father, and consequently when we establish a Kṛṣṇa conscious relationship, we become related to everyone. When one marries, he automatically establishes a relationship with the spouse’s family. Similarly, if we reestablish our original relationship with Kṛṣṇa, we will establish our true relationship with everyone else. That is the ground for real universal love. Universal love is artificial and cannot endure unless we establish our relationship with the center. One is American if he is born in America, and thus other Americans become members of his family, but if he is born elsewhere, he has no relationship with Americans. On the mundane platform all relationships are relative. Our relationship with Kṛṣṇa, however, is eternal and not subject to time and circumstance. When we reestablish our relationship with Kṛṣṇa, the questions of universal brotherhood, justice, peace and prosperity will be answered. There is no possibility of realizing these higher ideals without Kṛṣṇa. If the central point is missing, how can there be brotherhood and peace? In //Bhagavad-gītā// the peace formula is clearly given. We have to understand that Kṛṣṇa is the only enjoyer. The consciousness of this is developed in a Kṛṣṇa conscious temple where the central point of all activities is Kṛṣṇa. All cooking is carried on for Kṛṣṇa, not for one’s own purposes. Ultimately we shall eat the //prasādam// (offered food), but when we cook we should think that we are cooking for Kṛṣṇa and not for ourselves.

All monies acquired are spent for Kṛṣṇa, in spreading His message in so many ways. Such a style of life, in which everything is done for Kṛṣṇa, promotes the development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness within the living entity. Our activities may remain the same; we simply have to understand that we are acting for Kṛṣṇa and not for our personal satisfaction. In this way we can come to our original consciousness and be happy. Unless one is established in his original consciousness, which is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is certain to be crazy",

Indeed, that is the very purpose for the finger, and if it cannot serve the whole body, it is diseased or useless. Similarly, as part and parcel we have to serve Kṛṣṇa and be subordinate to Him because as the supreme father He supplies all our necessities. Such a life of subordination to Kṛṣṇa is a normal life and is a life of actual liberation. Those who try to deny Kṛṣṇa and live outside of any relationship to Him are actually leading a sinful life. Śukadeva Gosvāmī and Mahārāja Parīkṣit discussed this subject, and Parīkṣit Mahārāja was anxious to know how the conditioned souls could be saved from their hellish lives. It is the natural desire of a Vaiṣṇava to save suffering humanity. Generally others do not care whether people suffer or not, but a Vaiṣṇava, a devotee of the Lord, is always thinking of how to alleviate the fallen condition of the people. Christians believe that through His crucifixion Lord Jesus Christ assimilated all the sinful activities of the world’s people. A devotee of the Lord is always thinking of how to assimilate the sufferings of others. A similar devotee was Vāsudeva Datta, who was Lord Caitanya’s associate. He told the Lord: \"Now that You have come, kindly deliver all people on this earth and take them to Vaikuṇṭha, the spiritual world. And if You think that they are so sinful that they cannot be delivered, please transfer all their sins unto me. I shall suffer for them.\" This is a Vaiṣṇava’s mercy.

If some atonement for our sinful activities is not performed, nature will not excuse us. We will have to suffer the effects of our sins in the next life. Such bondage to one’s material activities is called //karma-bandhanaḥ.// > yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra > loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ > tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya > mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara \"Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage.\" [[books:bg:3:9|(Bg. 3.9)]] One may kill an animal to enjoy eating it, but he will be bound by such an action. Thus in one’s next life he will become a cow or a goat, and the cow or goat will become a man and eat him. This is the Vedic statement, and as with all Vedic statements, one may believe it or not. Unfortunately, at present people are educated in such a way that they do not believe in the next life. Indeed, it seems that the more \"educated\" one becomes, the less he believes in God, in God’s law, in the next life and in sinful and pious activities. Thus modern education is simply preparing men to become animals. If there is no education to teach a human being what he is and whether or not",

Thus if a man thinks in the same way, how is he different from any other animal? //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// states: > yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tridhātuke > sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijyadhīḥ > yat tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij > janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva gokharaḥ \"For one who accepts the body---which is made of three elements---as his self, who has an affinity for intimate bodily relationships with his wife and children, who considers his land worshipable and who accepts the waters of holy places of pilgrimage but does not take advantage of the knowledge of the saintly persons there, is to be considered to be in illusion and no better than an ass or a cow.\" (Bhāg. 10.84.13) According to //Āyur Veda,// the material body is composed of three elements, //kapha-pitta-vātaiḥ//---mucus, bile and air. Within the body there is complex machinery which transforms food into liquid. There are so many complicated bodily processes going on, but what do we know of them? We say, \"This is my body,\" but what do we know about this body? Some people even claim, \"I am God,\" but they do not even know what is going on within their own bodies. The body is a bag of stool, urine, blood and bones. If one believes that intelligence comes out of stool, urine, blood and bones, he is a fool. Can we create intelligence by mixing stool, urine, bones and blood? Nonetheless people still think, \"I am this body.\" Therefore the scriptures say that whoever accepts this body as the self and accepts the bodily relations of wife, children and family as his own, is illusioned. The word //kalatra// means wife, and //ādi// means beginning. Because a man feels alone, he accepts a wife, and immediately there are children and then grandchildren. In this way there is expansion. //Strī means// \"that which expands,\" so //kalatrādiṣu// means\"expansions of the self,\" beginning from the wife. The word //bhauma// refers to the land of one’s birth, which the ignorant consider worshipable //(ijya-dhīḥ).// People are willing to give up their lives for the land where they were born, but they do not know that land, body, wife, children, country and society really have nothing to",

I am Brahman. I am not this matter.\" The sign of this joy is that one no longer feels hankering and lamentation. Within this world everyone is subject to lamentation for that which is lost and hankering for that which must be gained, but real gain is to understand oneself and to know one’s own identity. As long as we maintain the bodily conception of life, we have to abide by the laws of material nature as well as the laws of the state and all other laws. Thus this body is called conditional, because it is subject to different conditions. There are varieties of conditions, and regardless of the condition to which we are subjected, we are responsible. If we do not atone for sinful activities committed while in this body, we will have to suffer in the next body because we will get another body according to //karma (yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram) .// That is nature’s law. Śukadeva Gosvāmī therefore recommends that one undergo atonement according to the gravity of his sinful activities. One must follow the methods of atonement prescribed in the //śāstras,// otherwise there is no rescue. Parīkṣit Mahārāja, who was very intelligent, said, \"By atonement one can become free from sinful activity, but suppose a man has committed murder and then is killed-the sinful reaction of his murder is thus neutralized, but it is not guaranteed that in his next life he’ll not kill another man.\" Thus Parīkṣit Mahārāja noted that after atoning, people commit the same sins again. If a man is diseased, the physician may give him medicine and cure him, but it does not guarantee that he will not be attacked again by the same disease. Venereal",

Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja noted that although atonement may be good for counteracting sinful activities already committed, it does not prevent those sins from being committed again. Everyone can see that a man who commits murder is punished, but seeing this is not enough to deter one from killing. In every scripture and in every lawbook man is warned not to kill, yet no one is concerned with these laws. What is the remedy for this? //Dṛṣṭa-śrutābhyāṁ yat pāpaṁ.// By practical experience and by hearing from authorities, everyone knows what sinful activity is, and no one can say, \"I do not know what sin is.\" What is the value of atonement if one commits the same sin again and again after atoning? //Kvacin nivartate ’bhadrāt kvacic carati tat punaḥ prāyaścittam ato ’pārthaṁ manye kuñjara-śaucavat// [[books:sb:6:1:9|(Bhāg. 6.1.9)]]. When one is being punished, he thinks, \"What a mistake I have made! I shall not commit this sin anymore.\" But as soon as he is out of danger, he again commits the same sin. Habit is second nature; it is very difficult to break. //Śvā yadi kriyate rājā/ tat kiṁ nāśnāty upānaham (Hitopadeśa):// One may seat a dog on a royal throne, but as soon as he sees a shoe, he will immediately jump down and run after it simply because he is a dog. The canine qualities are there, and they cannot be changed simply by putting the dog on a throne. Similarly, we have acquired material qualities by associating with the three modes of material nature---//sattva guṇa, rajo guṇa and tamo guṇa//---and our habits are formed by association with these three qualities, which are the qualities of goodness, passion and ignorance. If, however, we disassociate ourselves from the three modes of material nature, our real spiritual nature is invoked. That is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no chance of his associating with the three modes of material nature, and when one is conscious of Kṛṣṇa, one’s spiritual nature is automatically invoked. That is the secret. Those who seriously follow the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, though previously habituated to many undesirable things, are",

Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja said: //kvacin nivartate ’bhadrāt kvacic carati tat punaḥ prāyaścittam ato ’pārtham:// \"Repetitive sinning and atoning seem to me like nothing but a waste of time.\" He gave the example of an elephant which cleanses his body thoroughly in a lake or reservoir, but as soon as he comes onto shore he takes dust and throws it all over his body and immediately becomes dirty again. Thus Parīkṣit Mahārāja said that although one may cleanse himself in the process of atonement, if he again commits the same sinful acts, what is the use? Therefore the second question put by Parīkṣit Mahārāja to Śukadeva Gosvāmī is very important: How can one ultimately become free from all contamination brought about by the material modes of nature? If one cannot achieve liberation, what is the use of atonement? In answer, Śukadeva Gosvāmī said that merely counteracting //karma,// fruitive activities, by other activities cannot bring one’s miseries to a final end. For example, the United Nations is attempting to establish peace in the world, but they cannot stop war. War breaks out again and again. After the First World War statesmen and diplomats manufactured the League of Nations. Then the Second World War came, and now they have devised the United Nations, but war is still going on. The actual goal is to stop war, but that cannot be done. By one action war is created, and by another action war is stopped for the time being, but again at the next opportunity there is another war. The cycle of sinful activities and atonement is like that. What we actually want is to be free from suffering and war, but that does not happen. Śukadeva Gosvāmī said that one kind of war causes a disturbance, and another kind of war stops it for some time, but that is not the ultimate solution to the problem. Śukadeva states that these troubles happen due to ignorance: //avidvad-adhikāritvāt. Avidvat// means \"lack of knowledge.\" //Avidvat-adhikāritvāt prāyaścittaṁ vimarśanam.// Real atonement is performed in knowledge. Why is there fighting and why are there miseries?

What is my constitutional position? Where shall I go after death? Why am I put into a miserable form of life? Why are there birth, death, old age and disease?\" How can these questions be solved? Śukadeva Gosvāmī says: //nāśnataḥ pathyam evānnaṁ vyādhayo ’bhibhavanti hi/ evaṁ niyamakṛd rājan śanaiḥ kṣemāya kalpate.// If one wants to actually stop diseased life, he must follow a regulative principle. If a person does not follow the program given by a physician to cure his disease, he cannot be cured. Similarly, if one does not think or act wisely, as Vedic knowledge prescribes, how can he stop the problems of life? Simply by atonement there may be a temporary suppression of difficulties, but they will arise again. Śukadeva Gosvāmī says that in material or sinful life we act in a way in which we are forced to commit sins and suffer as a result. This is so, and if we want to stop this cycle of suffering and victimization, we have to advance in knowledge. Ordinary people, or //karmīs,// are fruitive actors who work all day and night to get some enjoyable results and then again suffer. Thus the problems of such //karmīs// are never solved. It is suggested therefore that one elevate himself to the platform of knowledge as prescribed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The first necessity is //tapasya,// or acceptance of austerity. If a doctor advises a diabetic patient not to eat but to starve for some days, although no one likes to starve, the patient must voluntarily accept starvation if he wants to be cured. This is //tapasya:// voluntary acceptance of a miserable condition. The ability to do this is good, and human life is meant for that purpose. Indeed, Vedic culture prescribes //tapasya,// and one can see many //tapasvīs// undergoing austerities in India. In the winter they stand in water up to their necks and meditate. Standing in water during severe cold is not very comfortable, but they voluntarily do it. In the summer they also ignite fires all around themselves and sit down in the midst of the blazes and meditate. These are examples of severe //tapasya//",

If one wants to become an initiated member of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, we first of all ask him to undergo //tapasya.// In the Western countries especially it is a great //tapasya// to give up illicit sex life, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. Although we require only these austerities, it is very difficult to observe them. In England, a wealthy aristocrat inquired from a Vaiṣṇava Godbrother: \"Swāmījī, can you make me a //brāhmaṇa?\"// The Swāmījī replied, \"Yes, why not? You just have to observe these four principles---no illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating.\" \"Impossible,\" the Britisher replied. Yes, it is impossible, for in Europe or in America self-indulgence is the way of life from the very beginning. Indian gentlemen often come to the West to learn these indulgences, and they think themselves to be thus advancing. Indians are automatically taught //tapasya// through their Vedic culture, but they come to America to forget that culture and accept another type of life. The real fact is, however, that if one wants to advance in spiritual understanding and solve all the problems of life, he must accept this life of //tapasya//---austerity and restriction. Restriction is for human beings, not for animals. We encounter restrictions daily in our common dealings. We cannot drive a car on the left or run a red light without risking apprehension by the law. If a dog, however, walks on the left side of the street or crosses against a red light, it is not punished because it is an animal. The law therefore makes distinctions between human beings and animals because human beings supposedly have advanced consciousness. If we do not follow rules and regulations, we again lapse into animalism. Apparently propaganda is being made celebrating freedom as opposed to a regulated life, but one who sees things as they are can understand that freedom from all restriction is animal life.

In the present age people have become degraded for want of //tapasya// because they are not taught how to execute //tapasvī// life. Criticism for its own sake will not do; one must be effectively trained in the life of //tapasya.// In the //Vedas// it is said that those who execute a regulated life of //tapasya// are //brāhmaṇas.

If one has a million dollars, he should not keep it, but, as long as it is within his jurisdiction, he should spend it for Kṛṣṇa. Money or energy is properly utilized when it is directed to Kṛṣṇa. As soon as one quits his body, all his monetary resources and everything else that he has collected in connection with his body is finished, for the spirit soul transmigrates to another body, and one does not know where the money which he earned in his previous body is being kept or how it is being spent. A person may leave the world declaring how the money should be spent by his sons or heirs, but even if one leaves millions of dollars, in his next life he has no claim to it. Therefore as long as it is in one’s hand, it is better to spend it for a good purpose. If one spends it for bad purposes, he becomes entangled, but if he spends it for good purposes, he gets good in return. This is very clearly stated in //Bhagavad-gītā.// //Bhagavad-gītā// explains that there are three kinds of charity---charity in the mode of goodness, passion and ignorance.

If one who has something is not God conscious, it is to be understood that he has stolen God’s property. That is the nature of material life. If this is considered thoughtfully and if one comes to real knowledge, he will realize that if we do not understand God, whose property we are using, whatever we possess is stolen property. It is also stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// that if one does not spend his money for //yajña,// sacrifice, he is understood to be a thief //(yo bhuṅkte stena eva saḥ).// For instance, if one earns a great deal of money but tries to hide it to avoid paying income tax, the government considers him to be a criminal. He cannot say, \"I have earned this money. Why shall I pay tax to the government?\" No, he must pay or risk punishment. Similarly, in the higher sense everything we have is Kṛṣṇa’s or God’s, and it must be utilized in accordance with His desires. We may wish to construct a building, but where do we get the stone, wood and earth that the construction requires? We cannot artificially produce the wood; it is God’s property.

A child may take a hundred dollar bill from his father and try to keep it although he may not know how to use it. The father may beg the child, \"Dear boy, kindly give it to me.\" The child does not know that the money actually belongs to the father, nor does he know that he had best hand it to his father, for he simply does not know how to use it. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa says, \"Renounce your work for Me. Renounce your wealth and property for Me.\" Kṛṣṇa is not a beggar, for everything belongs to Him, but He does treat us like small children. Compliance to His request to give everything to Him is called //tyāga,// renunciation, and is one of the means by which one can attain elevation to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Austerity, celibacy, equanimity and charity are all required for realization of the ultimate or Absolute Truth. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not concerned with the relative truth but with the Absolute. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// Vyāsadeva offers his obeisances to the Supreme Absolute Truth //(satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi).// He offers his respects not to the relative categorical truths, but to the //summum bonum,// the Absolute Truth. It is the duty of //brāhmaṇas// to practice those qualities by which the Absolute Truth can be realized. //Brāhmaṇas// must be qualified by practicing cleanliness, truthfulness, control of the mind and the senses, simplicity, and by cultivating faith in the //Vedas// and particularly in //Bhagavad-gītā.// When Kṛṣṇa says, \"I am the Supreme Lord,\" we have to accept Him with faith, not foolishly, but with full knowledge, and practically apply this acceptance in our daily life. A //brāhmaṇa// is not created by birth, but by education, practice and knowledge. It is not a question of birth, but quality, as pointed out by Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā:// > cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ > guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ > tasya kartāram api māṁ > viddhy akartāram avyayam \"According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.

If one is a qualified engineer but simply sits down at home and does not work, what is his value? Similarly, unless one works as a //brāhmaṇa,// there is no value to his simply saying, \"I am a //brāhmaṇa.//\" One must therefore work as a //brāhmaṇa// by fully engaging in the service of Paraṁ Brahman, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Brahman. How can service to the Absolute Truth be executed? //Yamena niyamena ca:// the practice of //yoga,// or linking with the supreme, is based on the principles of regulation and control. Regulation cannot be executed without control; therefore one must be thoughtful and purify himself. If one wants to pass an examination, he has to go to school, follow the principles of the school, and take some pains in his study, and then gradually he comes to be successful. If he plays all day on the street, how can he expect success? Therefore in the process being explained by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the first necessity is //tapasya,// austerity. Even if austerity and //brahmacarya// are painful because we want to be unrestricted, as soon as we are regulated, what appeared to be painful is in practice not painful. There are two classes of men---those who are sober //(dhīra)// and those who are extravagant //(adhīra).// When one, in spite of provocation or in spite of the presence of a source of mental agitation, can remain steady in his position, he is called //dhīra.// An example of a //dhīra// is given by Kālidāsa Paṇḍita, a great Sanskrit poet who wrote a book called //Kumāra-sambhava,// wherein he has given an example concerning Lord Śiva. It appears that when the demigods were fighting the demons and were being defeated, they decided that they could be saved by a commander-in-chief born from the semina of Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva, however, was in meditation, and to acquire the needed semina was very difficult. They therefore sent Pārvatī, a young girl, who appeared before Lord Śiva and worshiped his genitals. Although this young girl sat before Lord Śiva and touched his genitals, Lord Śiva was steady in meditation. Kālidāsa says, \"Here is an example of a //dhīra,//",

I could not finish my chanting. Come tonight again.\" The prostitute came for three nights, and on the third night she fell down at his feet, confessed her intentions, and pleaded with him, \"I was induced to perform this act by a man who is your enemy. Kindly excuse me.\" Haridāsa Ṭhākura then replied, \"I know all about that, but I allowed you to come here for three days so that you could be converted and become a devotee. Now take these chanting beads, and go on chanting. I am leaving this place.\" Here is another example of a //dhīra// who has control of his body //(deha),// words //(vāc),// and intelligence //(buddhi).// One’s body, words and intelligence should be controlled by one who is //dhīra// and who actually knows the principles of religion. We have been continuously committing sinful activities since time immemorial, and we do not know when this began, but this life is meant for rectification of all the mistakes that we have committed. If one sets fire to unwanted grass and creepers in a field, they will all be burned. Similarly, by the process of austerity and penance, one can liquidate all sinful activities and become purified. But Śukadeva Gosvāmī suggests an alternate process: //kecit kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ/ aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.// Generally, if one leads an austere and pious life of celibacy, equanimity, charity, etc., people will say that he is a very pious man, but simply by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, one can kill all the resultant actions of his past sinful life. A fog disappears as soon as the sun rises, and Kṛṣṇa rises with the brilliance of thousands of suns. This process is accepted only by someone who is very fortunate. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said: //brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva/ guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja:// \" By the grace of Kṛṣṇa and the spiritual master, a fortunate person, after wandering throughout the universe",

One should not render devotional service just to increase his income. We want money to become happy, but if we take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, automatically we will become so happy that we will neglect money. Money will automatically come. Happiness will come. There is no need to endeavor for these things separately. It was Dhruva Mahārāja who lamented, \"How foolish I was that I took to devotional service with a desire for material profit.\" Ordinarily for material profit one goes to his boss or some rich man or demigod, but a devotee does not go anywhere but to Kṛṣṇa, even if he has material desires. If one goes to Kṛṣṇa even for material advantages, the day will come when he forgets material desires, just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He was repentant, and said, \"I came to Kṛṣṇa and asked for something material, just like one who has pleased a very rich man and who asks him for a few grains of rice.\" If a rich man agrees to give us whatever we want, but we ask him only for a few grains of rice, is that very intelligent? Asking Kṛṣṇa for material benefit is exactly like this. One need not ask Kṛṣṇa extraneously for material happiness, for material happiness will automatically roll before his very feet, pleading, \"Please take me, please take me.\" Those who are practicing Kṛṣṇa consciousness are not in need of the material opulences---wives, children, happiness, home---for all is acquired automatically by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. There is no need to ask Kṛṣṇa for these material things, but one should simply request Him: \"Please engage me in Your service.\" In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa also promises that if one engages in His service, He will supply what is needed and preserve whatever is already possessed.

Contemporary civilization is by in large an assembly of animals because, as stated before, it operates on the basis of the animal propensities. The birds and beasts arise early in the morning and busy themselves trying to find food and sex and trying to defend themselves; at night they look for shelter, and in the morning they fly to a tree to find nuts and fruits. Similarly, in New York City, great hordes of people travel from one island to another by ferry boat or wait for subways in order to go to the office for the purpose of finding food. How is this an advancement over animal life? Although the ferry and subway are always crowded, and many people have to travel forty or fifty miles for bread, the birds are free to fly from one tree to another. Real civilization is not concerned simply with man’s animal needs but with enabling man to understand his relationship with God, the supreme father. One may learn about his relationship with God by any process---through Christianity, through the Vedic literatures or through the //Koran//---but in any case it must be learned. The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not to make Christians into Hindus or Hindus into Christians but to inform everyone that the duty of a human being is to understand his relationship with God. One must learn this, otherwise he is simply wasting his time by engaging in animalistic propensities. We must all try to love Kṛṣṇa or God. If one has a process, he should practice it, or he can come and learn this process. One should not begrudge the selection of one process over another. //Viṣād apy amṛtaṁ grāhyam amedhyād api kāñcanam/ nīcād apy",

Similarly, although according to the Vedic system of education one must be given instruction by intellectual persons like //brāhmaṇas,// if someone lower on the social scale has learned the truth, one should accept him as a teacher and learn from him. One should not think that just because one is lowly born he should not be accepted as a teacher. Similarly, if one is serious about understanding God, he should not think, \"I am Christian,\" \"I am Hindu,\" or \"I am Muslim.\" If one is serious about understanding love of God, he should consider which process is practical. One should not think, \"Why should I follow Hindu or Vedic scriptures?\" The purpose of following the Vedic scriptures is to develop love of God. When students come to America for a higher education, they do not consider the fact that the teachers may be American, German or of other nationalities. If one wants a higher education, he simply comes and takes it.

Although there is enough food, everyone stocks more than is needed in order to make a profit or simply in order to hoard. In 1942, in India, there was an artificial famine created by people gathering money and stocking it unnecessarily. Wealthy men collected rice which was selling at six rupies a pound, and suddenly within a week the price rose to fifty rupies a pound. Consequently no rice was available on the market, and the people went hungry. An American gentleman present at the time remarked, \"If people in our country were starving in this way, there would have been a revolution.\" The people in India, however, are so trained and cultured that in spite of this artificial famine they did not revolt but preferred to die peacefully. Of course, this is only one instance, but it shows how problems are not created by God but by man. In Germany during the First World War the women went to church and prayed to God to send their husbands, sons and brothers back safely, but none of them came back. All of the women became atheists. They did not consider that God did not advocate the war and its problems. They went to Him for a Solution. When we create our own problems, we have to suffer the results. It is a fact, however, that the problems of one who takes to the shelter of Kṛṣṇa, God, are solved. For this reason, if for none other, one should apply his devotional service to Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ.// If one engages in devotional service to Vāsudeva, he will receive the highest knowledge without delay (janayaty āśu vairāgyam).

At no stage in His appearance on earth did He appear as an ordinary living entity. Even as a baby He performed miraculous feats way beyond the abilities of the ordinary living entity. One should not consider that when he is surrendering to Kṛṣṇa he is surrendering to an ordinary man but to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Indeed, that is confirmed by all Vedic literatures. //Aghaṁ dhunvanti:// All reactions to sinful activities are cancelled when one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa.

Our time is thus being wasted in constructing so many devices which give us temporary and artificial convenience at the price of a proportionate amount of inconvenience. This is all part of the law of karma, the law of action and reaction. For whatever we do, there must be a reaction by which we become entangled. That is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā:// > yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra > loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ > tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya > mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara \"Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world.",

Not only does Śukadeva Gosvāmī recommend unalloyed devotional service, but he further says that by devotional service one's sinful activities will be negated. Every one of us is more or less sinful, for if we were not sinful we would not have been put into material bodies. As soon as one is free from sinful life, he is liberated and transferred to the spiritual world in a spiritual body. The whole process is to cleanse oneself from the contamination of sinful or material life. Śukadeva Gosvāmī said, \"My dear king, those who are sinful can become purified from contamination by //tapa-ādibhiḥ,// practicing austerity.\" Śukadeva also said, however, that no one can become completely purified by executing this process of austerity. There are many examples of //yogīs// who practiced austerities but did not emerge completely pure. Viśvāmitra Muni, for example, was a //kṣatriya// who wanted to become a //brāhmaṇa// and therefore began to practice austerity. Later on, however, he became a victim of Menakā, a society girl of the heavenly planets. Because Viśvāmitra was not pure, he became entangled with her and begot a child. Therefore it is said that even if one performs austerities and penances, worldly circumstances are so implicating that somehow or other they will involve one again and again in the material modes of nature. There are many examples of sannyāsīs who give up the world, renouncing it as false, saying, \"Let me turn to Brahman,\" but they again become entangled in the work of the world when they set up hospitals and perform philanthropic work and welfare activities. If the world is false, why are they attracted to welfare activities? The philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness maintains that this world is not false but that it is temporary. God created this world, and He is true, so how can His creation be false? Because this is the creation of God, and God is the Absolute Truth, this creation",

A person may claim something within this world to be his property, but that is a false claim. It is a fact that it is someone's property, but it is God's property //(īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam).// This does not mean, however, that the property is false. What is false is the claim to the property, which is based upon a puffed up false consciousness that the individual is the proprietor, the master, or God. Everyone desires to be master or proprietor of something, then minister, then president, and then God. When everything else fails, the living entity wants to become God. The tendency is there to want to become the greatest of all, but the fact remains that God is the greatest and the living entity is small compared to Him. The smallest is not false, and the greatest is not false, but when the small thinks that he is great, that is false. We understand from Vedic literature that Brahman, or the spirit, is //aṇor aṇīyāṁsam,// smaller than an atom, and //mahato mahīyāṁsam,// greater than the greatest. As far as we can conceive, the space which contains the universe is the greatest, but Kṛṣṇa has shown millions of universes in His mouth. The greatness of God cannot be comprehended by the living entities, who are part and parcel of God. As living entities, we are very minute, infinitesimal, and God is infinite. Indeed, the magnitude of the individual spirit soul is so microscopic that it cannot be seen. One cannot even imagine it with his material senses. Therefore it is said that the spirit soul is smaller than an atom //(aṇor aṇīyāṁsam).// Since the living entities and Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, are both spirit, they are qualitatively one. Quantitatively, however, the Lord is great and the living entities are small. This fact can be accepted immediately on the basis of Vedic information. In //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is stated, //yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vila-jā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ:// many millions of universes come out of God's body when He exhales, and they again disappear when He inhales.

It has become fashionable to claim to be God, and fools accept such claims, but from the Vedic literatures we understand that God is not so cheap. As long as we are not making puffed up egocentered claims, we are already liberated. There is no need to actually seek liberation. But as long as one thinks, \"I am this body,\" he is not liberated. Liberation means knowing perfectly well that one's self is separate from the body. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī said, //prāyaścittaṁ vimarśanam:// \"Develop your knowledge; that will give you relief.\" Our knowledge is perfect when we come to know that we are very small particles of spiritual sparks, and that God, the supreme, the greatest spiritual identity, supplies all our necessities //(eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān).// By knowing ourselves as minute particles, part and parcel of God, we can understand that our duty is to serve God. God is the center of all creation, of the whole universal body; He is the enjoyer, and we are His servitors. As this conception becomes clear, we become liberated. Liberation entails freedom from all false conceptions. It is not that upon liberation one acquires ten hands. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// liberation is defined as //muktir hitvānyathā-rūpam. Mukti// means \"to give up,\" and //ānyathā-rūpam// denotes a false conception of life. This is to say that when one is situated in his original constitutional position, having given up all false notions, he is liberated. It is also said in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that by the aquisition of knowledge, one becomes liberated immediately. That knowledge can be very easily acquired, for it is simple: God is great, and I am very small; He is the supreme proprietor supplying all necessities, and I am His servant. Who can challenge this? It is a fact. We are simply under the false impression that we are this or that, and this leads us to the ultimate false impression that we are God. Yet we do not consider what manner of God we are. A small bodily disorder will send us to the physician. One who claims to be the supreme, therefore, should be understood to have fallen to the last snare",

He never laments, or desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. And in that state he achieves pure devotional service unto Me.\" [[books:bg:18:54|(Bg. 18.54)]] The joy which follows realization arises from understanding, \"I was illusioned by false notions for so long. What a fool I was! I was thinking that I was God, but now I can understand that I am God's eternal servant.\" Upon gaining such realization, one attains liberation and becomes //prasannātmā,// or jolly, for this is the constitutional position of the living entity. There is no lamentation when one is in pure consciousness, for he knows that he is a small part, a spiritual spark protected by the Supreme Lord. Where then is there scope for lamentation? A small child feels free as long as he knows that his father is there. He thinks, \"My father is standing by me, so I am free. No one can harm me.\" Similarly, when one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, he has complete faith that he is not in danger because Kṛṣṇa is protecting him. One who is thus surrendered to Kṛṣṇa is not subject to lamentation or desire, whereas one who is not God conscious simply hankers and laments. He hankers for that which he does not possess, and he laments for that which he did possess but has lost. A God conscious person is not subject to such misery. If something is lost, he knows that it is God's wish, and he thinks, \"God desired this, so it is all right.\" He does not desire anything, for he knows that all his necessities are being provided by Kṛṣṇa, the supreme father.

Indeed, it is stated, //vāñcā-kalpa-tarubhyaś ca krpā-sindhubhya eva ca:// A Vaiṣṇava or devotee of Kṛṣṇa is an ocean of mercy to others. He gives the greatest gift to society, for society is in dire need of God consciousness. A Vaiṣṇava bestows the priceless gift of the //mahāmantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Simply by chanting this mantra, one can remain in a liberated state. One should not think, however, that this state is simply a state of trance whereby one remains seated in lotus position in a corner for days on end. No, liberation means serving. One cannot simply say, \"Now I have dedicated my life to Kṛṣṇa. Let me remain seated in //samādhi.//\" The standard of surrender must be maintained by //niṣevayā,// serving. As one serves the Supreme Lord, the Lord reveals Himself within the heart. The program of devotional service to the Lord is executed from morning to night. Indeed, Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā// that one must engage in devotional service to Him twenty-four hours a day. It is not that we should meditate for fifteen minutes and then engage in all kinds of nonsense. The more we serve, the more dedicated to Kṛṣṇa we become; therefore a person should utilize whatever talents he has for Kṛṣṇa. There are nine processes of devotional service---hearing, chanting, remembering, serving, worshiping the Deity in the temple, praying, carrying out orders, serving the Lord as friend, and sacrificing everything for Him---and one should always keep engaged in at least one of these nine processes. One who is always engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service never becomes disgusted //(bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam).// Service must be rendered with love, but in the beginning this may be difficult, and so one may become disgusted.

For example, if one chants Hare Kṛṣṇa throughout his life, he will not grow tired of the names, but if one chants a material name over and over, he will soon become disgusted. The more one chants the names of Kṛṣṇa, the more he becomes attached. Thus service by śravaṇam and //kīrtanam,// hearing and chanting about Kṛṣṇa, is the beginning. The next process is //smaraṇam//---always remembering Kṛṣṇa. When one is perfect in chanting and hearing, he will always remember Kṛṣṇa. In this third stage, he becomes the greatest yogī. Nor is progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness ever lost. In the material world, if one begins to construct a factory but does not complete it, the factory is useless for all intents and purposes. If the construction is stopped and the building half finished, whatever money is invested is lost. This is not the case with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for even if one does not come to the perfectional point, whatever work he does is his permanent asset, and he can begin from that point in his next life. Kṛṣṇa also confirms in Bhagavad-gītā that one who begins Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot lose anything: > nehābhikrama-nāśo 'sti > pratyavāyo na vidyate > sv-alpam apy asya dharmasya > trāyate mahato bhayāt \"In this endeavor there is no loss or diminution, and a little advancement on this path can protect one from the most dangerous type of fear.\" [[books:bg:2:40|(Bg. 2.40)]] In the Sixth Chapter of Bhagavad-gītā, when Arjuna asks about the fate of the unsuccessful yogī, Śrī Kṛṣṇa replies: > pārtha naiveha nāmutra > vināśas tasya vidyate > na hi kalyāṇa-kṛt kaścid > durgatiṁ tāta gacchati \"Son of Pṛthā, a transcendentalist engaged in auspicious activities does not meet with destruction either in this world or in the spiritual world; one who does good, My friend, is never overcome by evil.\" [[books:bg:6:40|(Bg. 6.40)]] The Lord then indicates that the unsuccessful yogī takes up his practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness",

However, one should not think that he will do well to wait for the next life to attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We should try to fulfill the mission of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this life. Kṛṣṇa promises us that one who becomes His devotee will come to Him without fail: > man-manā bhava mad-bhakto > mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru > mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te > pratijāne priyo 'si me \"Always think of Me.

Kṛṣṇa, God, is a person, just as we are persons. Materially we can understand that our father is a person, and that his father is also a person, and that his father's father is a person and so on back to the supreme father, who must also be a person. This is not very difficult to understand, and it is noteworthy that God is called the supreme father not only in the //Vedas// but in the Bible, Koran, and other scriptures. The //Vedānta-sūtra// also confirms that the Absolute Truth is the original father from whom everything has taken birth or emanated. This is also confirmed in the Vedas: > nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām > eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān \"The Lord is the supreme eternal amongst all eternals and the supreme living entity amongst all living entities. He is maintaining all others.\" The desires and life symptoms displayed by all living entities are simply reflections of the desires and life symptoms of the supreme father. In other words, our desires are born because He has desires. Because we are part and parcel of God, we have all the instincts of God in minute quantity. The sex play",

We must therefore plan our lives in such a way that it will not be possible for us to forget Kṛṣṇa for a moment. In this way, by engaging in the service of Kṛṣṇa, we will therefore always live in Vaikuṇṭha or Vṛndāvana, the abode of Kṛṣṇa. At present, due to our polluted consciousness, we are turning the world into a materialistic and hellish place, and because we are ignorant of our constitutional position, we have created innumerable problems, just as in dreams we create so many problems. But in actuality there are no problems. I may dream that I am in a great storm, or that I am being pursued, or that someone is taking my money, or that I am being devoured by a tiger, but actually these are all creations of my mind. //Asaṅgo hy ayaṁ puruṣa iti śruteḥ.// The //Vedas// say that the //puruṣa// (the ātmā or the soul) has no connection with all its dreamlike material activities. Therefore we must engage in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness process to awaken from this dreaming condition. Above all the fruitive laborers, speculators, and mystic yogīs are the bhaktas, or devotees of Kṛṣṇa. A bhakta can be perfectly peaceful, whereas the others cannot because everyone but the bhakta, one who has pure love, has desire. A //śuddha-bhakta// is desireless because he is simply happy serving Kṛṣṇa. He does not know or even care whether Kṛṣṇa is God or not; he just wants to love Kṛṣṇa. Nor is he concerned with the fact that Kṛṣṇa is omnipotent or that He is all-pervasive. In Vṛndāvana, the cowherd boys and the gopīs did not know whether Kṛṣṇa was God or not, but they simply loved Him.

A person who is honest can always see Kṛṣṇa everywhere. Kṛṣṇa says, \"Try to understand Me.

Similarly, as soon as there is sunrise or moonshine, we can see Kṛṣṇa, for He says, //prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:// \"I am the sun and moon.\" At a further stage we can see Kṛṣṇa as the life force within everything, as He indicates in //Bhagavad-gītā:// > puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca > tejaś cāsmi vibhāvasau > jīvanaṁ sarva-bhūteṣu > tapaś cāsmi tapasviṣu \"I am the original fragrance of the earth, and I am the light in fire.

Gentlemen, the offering of such an homage as has been arranged this evening to the Ācāryadeva is not a sectarian concern, for when we speak of the fundamental principle of gurudeva, or ācāryadeva, we speak of something that is of universal application. There does not arise any question of discriminating my guru from yours or anyone else's. There is only one guru, who appears in an infinity of forms to teach you, me, and all others. The guru,or ācāryadeva,as we learn from the bona fide scriptures, delivers the message of the absolute world, the transcendental abode of the Absolute Truth. We have heard so many times: mahā-jano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ (\"Traverse the trail which your previous ācāryahas passed\"), but we have hardly tried to understand the real purport of this śloka. If we scrutinizingly study this proposition, we can understand that the mahā-janais one and the royal road to the transcendental world is also one.

    "text": "brahma-niṣṭham **\"In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplic succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth.\"** Thus it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru. Therefore, if the Absolute Truth is one, about which we think there is no difference of opinion, the gurualso cannot be two. The Ācāryadeva to whom we have assembled tonight to offer our humble homage is not the guruof a sectarian institution or one out of many differing exponents of the truth. On the contrary, he is the Jagad-guru, the guruof all of us; the only difference is that some obey him wholeheartedly, while others do not obey him directly. In the Bhāgavatam [SB 11.17.27] it is said: > ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit > na martya-buddhyāsūyeta sarva-deva-mayo guruḥ **\"One should understand the spiritual master to be as good as I am,\"** said the Blessed Lord. **\"Nobody should be jealous of the spiritual master or think of him as an ordinary man, because the spiritual master is the sum total of all the demigods.\"** That is, the ācārya has been identified with God Himself. He has nothing to do with the affairs of this mundane world. He does not descend here to meddle with the affairs of temporary necessities but to deliver the fallen, conditioned souls---the souls, or entities, who have come here to the material world with a motive of enjoyment by the mind and five organs of sense perception. He appears before us to reveal the light of the Vedasand to bestow upon us the blessings of full-fledged freedom, after which we should hanker at every step of our life's journey. The transcendental knowledge of the Vedaswas first uttered by God to Brahmā, the creator of this particular universe. From Brahmā the knowledge descended to Nārada, from Nārada to Vyāsadeva, and from Vyāsadeva to Madhva, and in this process of disciplic succession the transcendental knowledge was transmitted by one disciple to another till it reached Lord Gaurāṅga, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, who posed as the disciple and successor of Śrī Īśvara Purī. The present Ācāryadeva is the tenth disciplic representative from Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, the original representative of Lord Caitanya who preached this transcendental tradition in its fullness.",

We adore this auspicious day as Śrī Vyāsa-pūjā-tithi because the ācāryais the living representative of Vyāsadeva, the divine compiler of the Vedas, Purāṇas, Bhagavad-gītā, Mahābhārata,and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. One who interprets the divine sound, or śabda-brahma, by his imperfect sense perception cannot be a real spiritual guru,because in the absence of proper disciplinary training under the bona fide ācārya,the interpreter is sure to differ from Vyāsadeva (as the Māyāvādīs do). Śrīla Vyāsadeva is the prime authority of Vedic revelation, and therefore such an irrelevant interpreter cannot be accepted as the guru, or ācārya, howsoever equipped he may be with all the acquirements of material knowledge. As it is said in the Padma Purāṇa, sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantrās te niṣphalā matāḥ:\"Unless you are initiated by a bona fide spiritual master in the disciplic succession, the mantra that you might have received is without any effect.\" On the other hand, one who has received the transcendental knowledge by aural reception from the bona fide preceptor in the disciplic chain, and who has sincere regard for the real ācārya,must needs be enlightened with the revealed knowledge of the Vedas. But this knowledge is permanently sealed to the cognitive approach of the empiricists. As it is said in Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad [6.23]: > yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau > tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante mahātmanaḥ **\"Only unto those great souls who simultaneously have implicit faith in both the Lord and the spiritual master are all the imports of Vedic knowledge automatically revealed.\"** Gentlemen, our knowledge is so poor, our senses are so imperfect, and our sources are so limited that it is not possible for us to have even the slightest knowledge of the absolute region without surrendering ourselves at the louts feet of Śrī Vyāsadeva or his bona fide representative. Every moment we are being deceived by the knowledge of our direct perception. It is all the creation or concoction of the mind, which is always deceiving, changing, and flickering. We cannot know anything of the transcendental region by our limited, perverted method of observation and experiment. But all of us can lend our eager ears for the aural reception",

Therefore, gentlemen, we should surrender ourselves today at the feet of the representative of Śrī Vyāsadeva for the elimination of all our differences bred by our unsubmissive attitude. It is accordingly said in Śrī Gītā [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]: > tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā > upadekśyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ **\"Just approach the wise and bona fide spiritual master.

Actual performance of service to the Absolute under the guidance of the ācāryais the only vehicle by which we can assimilate the transcendental knowledge. Today's meeting for offering our humble services and homage to the feet of the Ācāryadeva will enable us to be favored with the capacity of assimilating the transcendental knowledge so kindly transmitted by him to all persons without distinction. Gentlemen, we are all more or less proud of our past Indian civilization, but we actually do not know the real nature of that civilization. We cannot be proud of our past material civilization, which is now a thousand times greater than in days gone by. It is said that we are passing through the age of darkness, the Kali-yuga. What is this darkness? The darkness cannot be due to backwardness in material knowledge, because we now have more of it than formerly. If not we ourselves, our neighbors at any rate have plenty of it. Therefore, we must conclude that the darkness of the present age is not due to a lack of material advancement, but that we have lost the clue to our spiritual advancement, which is the prime necessity of human life and the criterion of the highest type of human civilization. Throwing bombs from airplanes is no advancement of civilization from the primitive, uncivilized practice of dropping big stones on the heads of enemies from the tops of hills. Improvement in the art of killing our neighbors by means of machine guns and poisonous gases",

Nor does the development of a sense of pampered selfishness prove anything more than intellectual animalism. True human civilization is very different from all these states, and therefore in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad [1.3.14] there is the emphatic call: > uttiṣṭhata jāgrata prāpya varān nibodhata > kṣurasya dhārā niśitā duratyayā > durgaṁ pathas tat kavayo vadanti **\"Please wake up and try to understand the boon which you now have in this human form of life. The path of spiritual realization is very difficult; it is sharp like a razor's edge. That is the opinion of learned, transcendental scholars.\"** Thus, while others were yet in the womb of historical oblivion, the sages of India had developed a different kind of civilization, which enabled them to know themselves. They had discovered that we are not at all material entities, but that we are all spiritual, permanent, and indestructible servants of the Absolute. But because we have, against our better judgment, chosen to completely identify ourselves with this present material existence, our sufferings have multiplied according to the inexorable law of birth and death, with its consequent diseases and anxieties. These sufferings cannot be really mitigated by any provision of material happiness, because matter and spirit are completely different elements. It is just as if you took an aquatic animal out of water and put it on the land, supplying all manner of happiness possible on land. The deadly sufferings of the animal are not capable of being relieved at all until it is taken out of its foreign environment. Spirit and matter are completely contradictory things. All of us are spiritual entities. We cannot have perfect happiness, which is our birthright, however much we may meddle with the affairs of the mundane things. Perfect happiness can by ours only when we are restored to our natural state of spiritual existence. This is the distinctive message of our ancient Indian civilization, this is the message of the Gītā,this is the message of the Vedasand the Purāṇas,and this is the message of all the real ācāryas,including our present Ācāryadeva, in the line of Lord Caitanya.

All of us should hear him patiently. If we listen to the transcendental sound without unnecessary opposition, he will surely have mercy upon us. The ācārya'smessage is to take us back to our original home, back to God. Let me repeat, therefore, that we should hear him patiently, follow him in the measure of our conviction, and bow down at his lotus feet for releasing us from our present causeless unwillingness for serving the Absolute and all souls. From the Gītāwe learn that even after the destruction of the body, the ātmā,or the soul, is not destroyed; he is always the same, always new and fresh. Fire cannot burn him, water cannot dissolve him, the air cannot dry him up, and the sword cannot kill him. He is everlasting and eternal, and this is also confirmed in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam [SB 10.84.13]: > yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke > sva-dhiḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ > yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij > janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ **\"Anyone who accepts this bodily bag of three elements [bile, mucus, and air] as his self, who has an affinity for an intimate relationship with his wife and children, who considers his land as worshipable, who takes bath in the waters of the holy places of pilgrimage but never takes advantage of those persons who are in actual knowledge---he is no better than an ass or a cow.\"** Unfortunately, in these days we have all been turned foolish by neglecting our real comfort and identifying the material cage with ourselves. We have concentrated all our energies for the meaningless upkeep of the material cage for its own sake, completely neglecting the captive soul within. The cage is meant for the undoing of the bird; the bird is not meant for the welfare of the cage. Let us, therefore, deeply ponder this. All our activities are now turned toward the upkeep of the cage, and the most we do is try to give some food to the mind by art and literature.

The message of the Ācāryadeva is to give us a warning to halt such wrong activities. Let us therefore bow down at his lotus feet for the unalloyed mercy and kindness he has bestowed upon us. Gentlemen, do not for a moment think that my Gurudeva wants to put a complete brake on the modern civilization---an impossible feat. But let us learn from him the art of making the best use of a bad bargain, and let us understand the importance of this human life, which is fit for the highest development of true consciousness. The best use of this rare human life should not be neglected. As it is said in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// [SB 11.9.29]: > labdhvā sudurlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte > mānuṣyam arthadam anityam apīha dhīraḥ > tūrṇaṁ yateta na pated anumṛtyu yāvan > niḥśreyasāya viṣayaḥ khalu sarvataḥ syāt **\"Human life is obtained after many, many births, and though it is temporary, it offers the highest benefits.

He should avoid sense gratification, which is available in all circumstances.\"** Let us not misuse this human life in the vain pursuit of material enjoyment, or, in other words, for the sake of only eating, sleeping, fearing, and sensuous activities. The Ācāryadeva's message is conveyed by the words of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī: > anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ > nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate > > prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ > mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate **\"One is said to be situated in the fully renounced order of life if he lives in accordance with Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Sitting at the feet of the Ācāryadeva, let us try to understand from this transcendental source of knowledge what we are, what is this universe, what is God, and what is our relationship with Him. The message of Lord Caitanya is the message for the living entities and the message of the living world. Lord Caitanya did not bother Himself for the upliftment of this dead world, which is suitably named Martyaloka, the world where everything is destined to die. He appeared before us four hundred fifty years ago to tell us something of the transcendental universe, where everything is permanent and everything is for the service of the Absolute. But recently Lord Caitanya has been misrepresented by some unscrupulous persons, and the highest philosophy of the Lord has been misinterpreted to be the cult of the lowest type of society. We are glad to announce tonight that our Ācāryadeva, with his unusual kindness, saved us from this horrible type of degradation, and therefore we bow down at his lotus feet with all humility. Gentlemen, it has been a mania of the cultured (or uncultured) society of the present day to accredit the Personality of Godhead with merely impersonal features and to stultify Him by claiming that He has no senses, no form, no activity, no head, no legs, and no enjoyment. This has also been the pleasure of the modern scholars due to their sheer lack of proper guidance and true introspection in the spiritual realm. All these empiricists think alike: all the enjoyable things should be monopolized by the human society, or by a particular class only, and the impersonal God should be a mere order supplier for their whimsical feats. We are happy that we have been relieved of this horrible type of malady by the mercy of His Divine Grace Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja. He is our eye-opener, our eternal father, our eternal preceptor, and our eternal guide. Let us therefore bow down at his lotus feet on this auspicious day.

We are now so much on the safe side that no amount of philosophical argument by the empiric schools of thought can deviate us an inch from the position of our eternal dependence on the lotus feet of His Divine Grace. Furthermore, we are prepared to challenge the most erudite scholars of the Māyāvāda school and prove that the personality of Godhead and His transcendental sports in Goloka alone constitute the sublime information of the Vedas. There are explicit indications of this in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad[8.13.1]: śyāmāc chavalaṁ prapadye śavalāc chyāmaṁ prapadye. \"For receiving the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, I surrender unto His energy [Rādhā], and for receiving the mercy of His energy, I surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.\" Also, in the Ṛg Veda[1.2.22.20]: tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayo divīva cakṣur ātataṁ. . . viṣṇor yat paramaṁ padam. \"The lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu are the supreme objective of all the demigods. These lotus feet of the Lord are as enlightening as the sun in the sky.\" The plain truth so vividly explained in the Gītā,which is the central lesson of the Vedas, is not understood or even suspected by the most powerful scholars of the empiric schools. Herein lies the secret of Śrī Vyāsa-pūjā. When we meditate on the transcendental pastimes of the Absolute Godhead, we are proud to feel that we are His eternal servitors, and we become jubilant and dance with joy. All glory to my divine master, for it is he who has out of his unceasing flow of mercy stirred up within us such a movement of eternal existence. Let us bow down at his louts feet. Gentlemen, had he not appeared before us to deliver us from the thralldom of this gross worldly delusion, surely we should have remained for lives and ages in the darkness of helpless captivity. Had he not appeared before us, we would not have been able to understand the eternal truth of the sublime teaching of Lord Caitanya. Had he not appeared before us, we could not have been able to know the significance of the first ślokaof Brahma-saṁhitā: > īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ > anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam",
