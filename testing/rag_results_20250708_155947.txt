TEXT: asked his wife, "What will make you comfortable?" A woman's nature, of course, is that she wants a good house, good food, fine garments, good children, and a good husband. These are a woman's ambitions. Thus Kardama Muni proved to her that she had received the best husband. By yogic powers he created for her this great airplane and gave her a big house with maidservants and all opulences. Kardama Muni was merely a human being, but he could perform such wonderful things by yogic powers. Kṛṣṇa, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers. If we get a little mystic power we become important, but Kṛṣṇa is the master of all mystic powers. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that wherever there is Yogeśvara, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the master of all mystic powers, and wherever there is Arjuna, who is also known as Pārtha or Dhanur-dhara, everything is present. We should always remember that if we can keep ourselves always in company with Kṛṣṇa, we shall attain all perfection. And especially in this age, Kṛṣṇa has incarnated as the holy name (//kali-kāle nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa-avatāra,// Cc. //Ādi// 17.22). Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says: > nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis > tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ "My dear Lord, You are so kind that You are giving me Your association in the form of Your holy name, and this holy name can be chanted in any situation." There are no hard and fast rules for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. One can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa anywhere. Children, for example, also chant and dance. It is not at all difficult. While walking, our students take their beads with them and chant. Where is the loss? But the gain is very great, for by chanting we associate with Kṛṣṇa personally. Suppose we were to associate personally with the President. How proud we would feel. "Oh, I am with the President." So should we not feel very much proud if we were to associate with the supreme president, who is able to create many millions of presidents like those of this world? This chanting is our opportunity to do so. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi:// "My dear Lord, You are so kind to me that You are always prepared to give me Your association." //Durdaivam

REFERENCE: chapter18 (Teachings of Queen Kunti)

TEXT: The process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be very vigorously propagated all over the world. Simply by seeing the Deity or simply by joining in chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// people will derive tremendous benefit. If one performs //kīrtana,// chanting, one will be able to think of Kṛṣṇa. One may think, "I danced for two hours and chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is the meaning of this?" This is //smaraṇa,// thinking of Kṛṣṇa. One may even think, "I foolishly chanted 'Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa' for two hours." But that also is //smaraṇa.// Because the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading, people are purchasing our books about Kṛṣṇa. Because they are curious they say, "What is this Kṛṣṇa? Let us see the book." Then they immediately see a picture of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and if they open the book they will see more. In the book there are many prayers glorifying Kṛṣṇa. So some will hear about Kṛṣṇa, and others will read, and if they are fortunate enough they will become Kṛṣṇa conscious and engage in the worship of the Deity. These methods of devotional service---hearing, chanting, remembering Kṛṣṇa, and so on---are so perfect that as soon as one takes to them (either all of them, some of them, or even one of them) one becomes purified. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī prays, "I offer my worship to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for simply by remembering Him, simply by glorifying Him, or simply by seeing Him, so many benefits follow." Śukadeva Gosvāmī is one of twelve important spiritual authorities, and these are the authorities we must follow (//mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]). He affirms that by performing these methods of devotional service one will be cleansed of material contamination. When? //Sadyaḥ:// immediately, without waiting. This is the great benefit of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

TEXT: or //Bhagavad-gītā// one becomes pious automatically. Therefore it is a rigid principle in every temple of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement that there must be a daily class for hearing and chanting. Our movement is meant for training spiritual leaders, but without hearing and chanting it is impossible to become a leader. Of course, in the material world it is possible, but not in the spiritual world. > mālī hañā sei bīja kare āropaṇa > śravaṇa-kīrtana jale karaye secana > [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]] Hearing and chanting waters the seed of devotional service, which develops one's original consciousness. So here, in these prayers, Kuntīdevī, a great devotee, is giving us an opportunity to become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by concentrating our mind on //paṅkaja,// the lotus flower. //Paṅka// means "mud," and //ja// means "generate." Although the lotus flower is generated from mud, it is a most important flower, and Kṛṣṇa likes it very much. Kuntīdevī therefore describes all the parts of Kṛṣṇa's body with reference to lotus flowers, so that as soon as one sees a lotus flower one will immediately think of Kṛṣṇa: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa's navel is just like a lotus, and from Kṛṣṇa's navel grew the stem of the lotus upon which Brahmā, the creator of this universe, was born. This universe includes so many planets, seas, mountains, and cities with motorcars and other paraphernalia, but the entire universe began from that lotus." //Namaḥ paṅkaja-māline// [[books:sb:1:8:22|[SB 1.8.22]]]. From Kṛṣṇa comes the wonderful lotus flower that contains the seed of the entire universe. But He is not the source of only one such flower. Kṛṣṇa is not so poor that He simply produces one lotus flower and then is finished. No. Just as there may be a garland with many flowers, Kṛṣṇa is the source of innumerable universes, which may be compared to a big garland of lotuses. This is God. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya/ jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// (Bs. 5.48). Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. We are very much concerned with this one planet, but Kṛṣṇa's creation contains an unlimited number of planets. We cannot count how many planets there are, any more than one can count how many hairs there are on one's head. This is the nature of Kṛṣṇa's creation. To give another example, on one tree there is an unlimited number of leaves. Similarly, there is an

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Session Title:** Glorifying the Supreme Lord Krsna: Unveiling the Glories of the Master of Yogic Powers

**Gita Reference:** Srimad Bhagavatam, Canto 1, Chapter 8, Text 20; Bhagavad-gita, Chapter 10, Text 8

**Opening Hook:**
Let's begin with a powerful quote from Srila Prabhupada: "Kṛṣṇa, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 13, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/13.txt/)

In this session, we'll delve into the glories of Lord Krsna, exploring His unlimited powers, creation, and the easiest way to attain perfection through association with Him.

**Core Teaching:**
Srila Prabhupada's commentary on the Teachings of Queen Kunti offers a profound understanding of Lord Krsna's glories. Let's examine five essential facts that highlight His supremacy.

Firstly, Krsna is the master of all yogic powers. This means that He possesses the ultimate control over the universe and its workings. As Srila Prabhupada explains, "Kṛṣṇa, however, is Yogeśvara, the master of all yogic powers." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 13, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/13.txt/)

Secondly, associating with Krsna through chanting His holy name is the easiest way to attain perfection. Srila Prabhupada emphasizes, "If we can keep ourselves always in company with Kṛṣṇa, we shall attain all perfection." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 13, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/13.txt/)

Thirdly, simply remembering Krsna, even in a casual way, can bring tremendous benefit. As Srila Prabhupada notes, "One may even think, 'I foolishly chanted "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa" for two hours.' But that also is smaraṇa." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 18, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/18.txt/)

Fourthly, hearing and chanting about Krsna is essential for spiritual growth. Srila Prabhupada stresses, "Our movement is meant for training spiritual leaders, but without hearing and chanting it is impossible to become a leader." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/5.txt/)

Lastly, Krsna is the source of innumerable universes, and His creation is unlimited. As Srila Prabhupada describes, "Kṛṣṇa is the source of innumerable universes, which may be compared to a big garland of lotuses." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 5, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/5.txt/)

**Frameworks or Levels:**
In understanding Lord Krsna's glories, we can categorize His powers into three levels:

1. **Yogic Powers:** Krsna's mastery over yogic powers demonstrates His control over the universe and its workings.
2. **Creation:** Krsna's unlimited creation, comprising innumerable universes, showcases His boundless energy and creativity.
3. **Association:** Associating with Krsna through chanting His holy name, remembering Him, and hearing about Him is the easiest way to attain perfection and spiritual growth.

**Practical Application:**
Reflect on the following questions:

* How can I increase my association with Krsna through chanting and hearing about Him?
* In what ways can I remember Krsna throughout my daily activities?
* How can I apply the understanding of Krsna's yogic powers and creation in my spiritual journey?

**Micro-practice:**
Commit to chanting the Hare Krsna mantra for at least 10 minutes daily, focusing on the sound and meaning of the mantra. As you chant, remember Krsna's glories and associate with Him.

**Closing Reflection:**
As Srila Prabhupada reminds us, "If we can keep ourselves always in company with Kṛṣṇa, we shall attain all perfection." [Teachings of Queen Kunti, Chapter 13, Purport](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tqk/13.txt/)

**Key Quotes:**
