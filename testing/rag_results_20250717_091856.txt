5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER

**Sri Guru Carana Padma**

**The Proper Way to Take Prasada**

In the sacred scriptures, it is written, "One who has taken his birth is sure to die, and after death one must take birth again. Therefore, the cycle of birth and death continues" (Bhagavad-gita 2.27). However, as devotees of the Lord, we are fortunate to have the guidance of Srila Prabhupada, who has illuminated the path to spiritual liberation. In this regard, the question arises: how much prasada should we take?

**The Principle of Moderation**

Srila Prabhupada teaches us that one should take prasada according to one's hunger. In the Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Chapter 26, Purport, he writes, "One should not take more than what he requires. Yāvad artham: one should take only what is necessary for his maintenance." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tlc/26.txt/)

This principle of moderation is essential in our spiritual journey. By taking only what is necessary, we avoid the pitfalls of sense gratification and cultivate a sense of detachment from material desires.

**Eating with Control**

Furthermore, Srila Prabhupada emphasizes the importance of eating prasada with control and not for sense gratification. In the Nectar of Devotion, Chapter 0, Text 4, he states, "One should not eat more than necessary, although the food is very palatable. And he should not eat for sense gratification." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/nod/0b.txt/)

This instruction is crucial, for when we eat with control, we demonstrate our commitment to spiritual growth and our willingness to transcend the bondage of material desires.

**Taking Prasada as a Token of Love**

Ultimately, the purpose of taking prasada is to express our love and devotion to Krishna. As Srila Prabhupada writes in the Teachings of Lord Kapila, Chapter 4, Text 51, "One should take prasādam at the time of breakfast, and the prasādam should be taken as a token of love of Godhead." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/blob/master/tlk/4.txt/)

By taking prasada as a token of love for Krishna, we cultivate a deeper sense of connection with the Divine and acknowledge the Lord's provision in our lives.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the proper way to take prasada is to take it in moderation, with control, and as a token of love for Krishna. By following these principles, we can transform our daily meals into an act of devotion and service to the Lord. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently puts it, "Prasādam is not meant
