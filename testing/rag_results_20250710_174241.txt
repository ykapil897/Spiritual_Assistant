TEXT: or //Bhagavad-gītā// one becomes pious automatically. Therefore it is a rigid principle in every temple of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement that there must be a daily class for hearing and chanting. Our movement is meant for training spiritual leaders, but without hearing and chanting it is impossible to become a leader. Of course, in the material world it is possible, but not in the spiritual world. > mālī hañā sei bīja kare āropaṇa > śravaṇa-kīrtana jale karaye secana > [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]] Hearing and chanting waters the seed of devotional service, which develops one's original consciousness. So here, in these prayers, Kuntīdevī, a great devotee, is giving us an opportunity to become Kṛṣṇa conscious simply by concentrating our mind on //paṅkaja,// the lotus flower. //Paṅka// means "mud," and //ja// means "generate." Although the lotus flower is generated from mud, it is a most important flower, and Kṛṣṇa likes it very much. Kuntīdevī therefore describes all the parts of Kṛṣṇa's body with reference to lotus flowers, so that as soon as one sees a lotus flower one will immediately think of Kṛṣṇa: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa's navel is just like a lotus, and from Kṛṣṇa's navel grew the stem of the lotus upon which Brahmā, the creator of this universe, was born. This universe includes so many planets, seas, mountains, and cities with motorcars and other paraphernalia, but the entire universe began from that lotus." //Namaḥ paṅkaja-māline// [[books:sb:1:8:22|[SB 1.8.22]]]. From Kṛṣṇa comes the wonderful lotus flower that contains the seed of the entire universe. But He is not the source of only one such flower. Kṛṣṇa is not so poor that He simply produces one lotus flower and then is finished. No. Just as there may be a garland with many flowers, Kṛṣṇa is the source of innumerable universes, which may be compared to a big garland of lotuses. This is God. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya/ jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// (Bs. 5.48). Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. We are very much concerned with this one planet, but Kṛṣṇa's creation contains an unlimited number of planets. We cannot count how many planets there are, any more than one can count how many hairs there are on one's head. This is the nature of Kṛṣṇa's creation. To give another example, on one tree there is an unlimited number of leaves. Similarly, there is an

REFERENCE: chapter18 (Teachings of Queen Kunti)

TEXT: The process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be very vigorously propagated all over the world. Simply by seeing the Deity or simply by joining in chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// people will derive tremendous benefit. If one performs //kīrtana,// chanting, one will be able to think of Kṛṣṇa. One may think, "I danced for two hours and chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is the meaning of this?" This is //smaraṇa,// thinking of Kṛṣṇa. One may even think, "I foolishly chanted 'Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa' for two hours." But that also is //smaraṇa.// Because the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading, people are purchasing our books about Kṛṣṇa. Because they are curious they say, "What is this Kṛṣṇa? Let us see the book." Then they immediately see a picture of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and if they open the book they will see more. In the book there are many prayers glorifying Kṛṣṇa. So some will hear about Kṛṣṇa, and others will read, and if they are fortunate enough they will become Kṛṣṇa conscious and engage in the worship of the Deity. These methods of devotional service---hearing, chanting, remembering Kṛṣṇa, and so on---are so perfect that as soon as one takes to them (either all of them, some of them, or even one of them) one becomes purified. Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī prays, "I offer my worship to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for simply by remembering Him, simply by glorifying Him, or simply by seeing Him, so many benefits follow." Śukadeva Gosvāmī is one of twelve important spiritual authorities, and these are the authorities we must follow (//mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]). He affirms that by performing these methods of devotional service one will be cleansed of material contamination. When? //Sadyaḥ:// immediately, without waiting. This is the great benefit of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

REFERENCE: introduction0 (Teachings of Queen Kunti)

TEXT: //she prays to suffer even more,// for she reasons that her suffering will increase her devotion to the Lord and bring her ultimate liberation: My dear Kṛṣṇa, Your Lordship has protected us from the poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest, and from the battle where great generals fought.... I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths. [[books:sb:1:8:24|(SB 1.8.24-25)]] Kuntī's words---the simple and illuminating outpourings of the soul of a great and saintly woman devotee---reveal both the deepest transcendental emotions of the heart and the most profound philosophical and theological penetrations of the intellect. Her words are words of glorification impelled by a divine love steeped in wisdom: O Lord of Madhu, as the Ganges forever flows to the sea without hindrance, let my attraction be constantly drawn unto You without being diverted to anyone else. [[books:sb:1:8:42|(SB 1.8.42)]] Kuntī's spontaneous glorification of Lord Kṛṣṇa and her description of the spiritual path are immortalized in the //Mahābhārata// and the //Bhāgavata Purāṇa// (//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam//), and they have been recited, chanted, and sung by sages and philosophers for thousands of years. As they appear in the First Canto of the //Bhāgavatam,// Queen Kuntī's celebrated prayers consist of only twenty-six couplets (verses 18 through 43 of the Eighth Chapter), yet they are considered a philosophical, theological, and literary masterpiece. The present book (//Teachings of Queen Kuntī//) includes those inspired verses and illuminating commentary by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, Founder-//Ācārya// of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness and the most renowned Vedic scholar and spiritual leader of our time. In addition to this commentary (originally written in 1962), //Teachings of Queen Kuntī// contains further explanations that Śrīla Prabhupāda gave more recently in an absorbing series of lectures. In those memorable talks, delivered in the spring of 1973 at ISKCON's Western world headquarters in Los Angeles, he analyzed the verses in significantly greater detail and shed even more light upon them. This new Bhaktivedanta Book Trust publication, complete with eleven color prints of exquisite original oil paintings, will be a prized addition to the libraries of all those who

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Session Title:** Glorifying the Supreme Lord Krsna: Insights from Queen Kunti's Prayers

**Gita Reference:** Srimad Bhagavatam 1.8.22, Brahma Samhita 5.48, Caitanya Caritamrta Madhya 17.186

**Opening Hook:**
In the midst of turmoil and uncertainty, Queen Kunti's prayers in the Srimad Bhagavatam offer us a beacon of hope and guidance. As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently puts it, "Namaḥ paṅkaja-māline" [SB 1.8.22]. This phrase, which means "Obeisances unto the lotus-eyed Lord," sets the tone for our exploration of how to glorify the Supreme Lord Krsna.

**Core Teaching:**
Queen Kunti's prayers are a masterclass in glorifying the Supreme Lord. By concentrating our mind on Krsna, we can become Krsna conscious. This is not a trivial pursuit, for as Srila Prabhupada explains, "Krsna is the source of innumerable universes, which can be compared to a big garland of lotuses" [Bs. 5.48]. This understanding of Krsna's majesty and omnipotence is the foundation upon which we can build our devotional practice.

**Frameworks or Levels:**
In our pursuit of glorifying the Supreme Lord, it's essential to recognize the various levels of devotional practice. Srila Prabhupada teaches us that simply by remembering Krsna, glorifying Him, or seeing Him, one can derive tremendous benefits and become purified [Cc. Madhya 17.186]. This is the essence of Krsna consciousness – to constantly remember and glorify the Supreme Lord in our thoughts, words, and actions.

**Practical Application:**
Take a few moments to reflect on your current devotional practice. Ask yourself:
* How often do I remember Krsna throughout the day?
* Do I regularly glorify Krsna through prayer, song, or service?
* How can I incorporate more opportunities to see Krsna, whether through deity worship, reading about His pastimes, or associating with devotees?

**Micro-practice:**
Commit to setting aside a few minutes each day to recite Queen Kunti's prayers, focusing on the phrase "Namaḥ paṅkaja-māline" [SB 1.8.22]. As you recite this mantra, visualize the lotus-eyed Lord Krsna and reflect on His majesty and omnipotence.

**Closing Reflection:**
As we conclude this session, let us remember Queen Kunti's heartfelt words: "My dear Kṛṣṇa, Your Lordship has protected us from the poisoned cake, from a great fire, from cannibals, from the vicious assembly, from sufferings during our exile in the forest, and from the battle where great generals fought.... I wish that all those calamities would happen again and again so that we could see You again and again, for seeing You means that we will no longer see repeated births and deaths" [SB 1.8.24-25]. May we, too, develop this level of devotion and longing to glorify the Supreme Lord Krsna.

**Key Quotes:**

* "Namaḥ paṅkaja-māline" [SB 1.8.22]
* "Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ" [Bs. 5.48]
* "Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ" [Cc. Madhya 17.186]

**Summary:**
In this session, we explored the importance of glorifying the Supreme Lord Krsna through the teachings of Queen Kunti. By concentrating our mind on Krsna, we can become Krsna conscious and derive tremendous benefits. We examined the various levels of devotional practice and reflected on our current practice, committing to incorporate more opportunities to remember, glorify, and see Krsna. May we continue to deepen our understanding of Krsna's majesty and omnipotence, and may our devotional practice be guided by the wisdom of Srila Prabhupada.
