**The Network of Ignorance**

So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that this body is a network of ignorance, simply sense gratification: "I shall eat this. I shall eat that. I shall hear this. I shall..." The ear is engaged in hearing nice cinema songs, and the tongue is engaged in going to the restaurant, enjoying so many so-called palatable dishes. Similarly, other senses, they are engaged.

**Controlling the Senses**

According to the bhakti-yoga system, the first control is recommended to the tongue. That is said, that "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ" [[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]. Now, we receive knowledge through the indriyas, but if the indriyas are impure—senses are impure—they cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. "Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi." Na, beginning. Because beginning is śravaṇam. Bhakti-mārga begins by hearing. Now, what is śravaṇam? Chanting. If there is chanting or there is some speaking, then we can hear. That is recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that simply hear.

**The Importance of Hearing**

So... But it is said, "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ." These present blunt senses, material senses, cannot receive even this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. They say, "This is nuisance." Bhagavān says in the Bhagavad-gītā, "catur-vidhā bhajante mām" [[Bg. 9.14]]: "Four classes of men who begin bhagavad bhajana," "sukṛtina," "those who are pious..." But the modern leaders, they say, "This bhajana is nuisance." This is our misfortune. "Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ" [[Bg. 9.14]]. These are the explanations in the Bhagavad-gītā. Saintly person, mahātmā, they are engaged in chanting satatam, always. "Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām" [[Bg. 9.14]]. Kīrtayantaḥ, glorifying.

**Glorifying the Lord**

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, "kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ. Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ" [[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]. This is the recommendation, that you should glorify the holy name of Hari. Hari means Kṛṣṇa. So that is the recommendation. But we are meeting so many obstacles because they think, "This chanting is nuisance. This bhajana is nuisance. This is Kali-yuga. Not the Kali-yuga; even every yuga." So "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ" [[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]. A devotee is hearing, he is enjoying, and the nondevotee is thinking, "It is nuisance." Therefore it is said, "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ." The blunt senses, material senses, they cannot receive. Nāmādi. Not only name; they cannot see Lord Kṛṣṇa's form. Because hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting and touching... We have got so many senses.

**Purifying the Senses**

So these senses being materially contaminated, it cannot hear what is Kṛṣṇa's holy name. "Ataḥ kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ" [[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]. Then how to understand Kṛṣṇa? That is recommended, "sevonmukhe hi jihvādau." You have to engage your tongue first of all in the service of the Lord. The Kṛṣṇa realization begins from the tongue. How? Now you simply make it a vow, that "I shall not accept anything that is not offered to Kṛṣṇa." And you take another vow, that "I shall not talk anything except glorifying the Lord." Then you become perfect. Very simple method. Simply you have to make this determination, that "I shall not talk anything which is not about Kṛṣṇa, and I shall not eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa."

**The Yoga System and Spiritual Senses**

If anyone wants to enjoy spiritual senses, then he has to control these material senses. That is the yoga system. **Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ**. By yoga practice, one controls the material senses. And when the yoga is complete, then the activities of the spiritual senses begin.

**The Bhagavad-gītā's Guidance**

Just like in the **Bhagavad-gītā** it is said, **brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā**. **Brahma-bhūtaḥ** means the material sense gratification stopped. That is, **brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā, na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu, mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām** [[Bg. 18.54]]. So after the activities of the material senses stopped, then the spiritual senses begin to work. So when from that spiritual senses we derive bliss, that is wanted. That is real **ānanda**.

**The Necessity of Tapasya**

To enjoy the spiritual sense, one has to not only stop, but undergo **tapasya, tapo divyam**. Just like a man is diseased, he wants to eat, but due to the disease he cannot eat. So first of all, you have to cure the disease, then your eating will be a pleasure. And if you want to eat in the diseased condition, then the taste will not be proper; you cannot eat. A man suffering from jaundice, if you give him sugar candy, he will taste it bitter. The same man, when he is cured, he will taste the sugar candy as very sweet. **Tapo divyaṁ yena putrakā śuddhyed sattvam** [[SB 5.5.1]]. You have to purify your existence by **tapasya**. And **tapasya** means stops material sense gratification.

**A Conversation with Dr. Movebhed**

[Dr. Movebhed enters the room]

**Dr. Movebhed:** Yes.

**Prabhupāda:** So **Bhagavad-gītā...** Kṛṣṇa is speaking **Bhagavad-gītā**. What is the position of Kṛṣṇa? That you have mentioned?

**Dr. Movebhed:** I have to listen to you. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:** Why you shall listen to me? The **Bhagavad-gītā** is there.

**Dr. Movebhed:** But you are an insider. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:** Yes, actually without listening, so many big, big men, they have committed mistake about **Bhagavad-gītā**. Even Gandhi, he says that "I do not believe that there was a person Kṛṣṇa ever living." Just see. What to speak of others. **Aiye.** [Hindi] Without listening from the right source, even a personality like Gandhi will commit mistake, what to speak of others. Similarly, Dr. Radhakrishnan has committed so many mistakes. So big, big scholars, they're trying to study **Bhagavad-gītā**, but they cannot understand.

**The Importance of Surrender**

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, **tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā** [[Bg. 4.34]]. You first prepare yourself to surrender, **praṇipāta, praṇipāta, prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa nipāta**. Without any reservation, surrender, **praṇipātena**, by the surrendering process, and **paripraśnena**, by enquiring from the authority. Because it is not very easy to understand Kṛṣṇa. **Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye** [[Bg. 7.3]]. Out of many, many million persons one try to understand, one trying to become perfect, **siddhaye**. **Siddhi** means perfection. So **yatatām api siddhānām** [[Bg. 7.3]]: "Those who have attained **siddhi**, perfection, out of many such **siddhas**," **kaścid māṁ vetti tattvataḥ**, "maybe one man can understand Me." The first of all to become **siddha**. Then, after becoming **siddha**, one may understand Kṛṣṇa or he may not. Actually, it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. But you can understand Kṛṣṇa if you adopt this process: **praṇipātena, paripraśnena, sevayā**---three things.

**Engaging the Senses in Kṛṣṇa Consciousness**

So, you practice, you decorate the Deity in the temple very beautifully with dress, with ornaments, with flowers. That means your propensity for seeing beautiful things will be satisfied; at the same time, you become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Your tongue wants to eat very nice things. All right, you get it – Kṛṣṇa-prasādam. Kṛṣṇa is offered the nicest cooked foodstuff. So, you satisfy your tongue; at the same time, you become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Utilizing the Senses for Kṛṣṇa**

So, Kṛṣṇa conscious movement is so nice that there is no forceful prohibition of the senses. Even the sense organ, generative organ, that can be used also for Kṛṣṇa. How? If you can beget children who will be Kṛṣṇa conscious, then produce hundred, one hundred children. Otherwise, stop producing cats and dogs.

**Purifying the Senses**

So, no sense is stopped, but you have to utilize it for Kṛṣṇa. You can walk to Kṛṣṇa's temple, you can dance to the tune of Kṛṣṇa's song, you can eat nice foodstuff, you can see very beautiful Deities, you can hear very beautiful sound, you can talk on Kṛṣṇa philosophically from Bhāgavata and Bhagavad-gītā. So, everything in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no stoppage. And devotional service means that purifying the senses and engaging them in the service of Kṛṣṇa.

**Freedom from Material Designations**

Tat-paratvena nirmalam. Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.
[Cc. Madhya 19.170]

One has to get himself freed from all material designations. We are impure because we are compact in designation: "Oh, I am Christian," "I am Hindu," "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am white," "I am black." So, these are all designation. If you simply know that "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa. I am servant of God," then you are purified. You are neither white nor black nor this nor that, but you are simple servant of Kṛṣṇa. If you continue this consciousness, then you are purified immediately. No more contamination.

**The Pure Condition**

Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.
[Cc. Madhya 19.170]

And as soon as you take it very seriously, that "I am Kṛṣṇa's" – neither to the society, neither to the community, neither to the country, neither to the international society, or neither anything, but "I am Kṛṣṇa's" – if this firm conviction is there, then you are completely pure: tat-paratvena nirmalam. And in the pure condition, when you engage your senses in the service of the Lord, that is called Kṛṣṇa conscious service or devotional service.

**A Life of Devotion**

**Prabhupāda:** But one cannot give up the family life, and it was an opportunity to give up family life.

**The Guiding Principles of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness**

You talked about things beyond the self. In the Bhagavad-gītā, I think you have references such as Arjuna being told not to become attached to the fruit of his actions, but act. Can you give us some idea of, more specifically, the principles which would guide one's action while trying to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness?

**Prabhupāda:** That principle is stated as the ultimate instruction of Bhagavad-gītā, that **sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja** [[Bg. 18.66]]. We have got two kinds of religion. One is called pravṛtti. Pravṛtti means we are inclined, because we have got this material body, we are inclined to material activities. That is called pravṛtti-mārga. **Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur** [[Bg. 3.42]]. This body means senses. So because so long we are absorbed in this bodily concept of life, then we try to give comforts to the senses, sense gratification. This is one stage.

**The Illusion of Sense Gratification**

So dharma means occupation. People are engaged in various types of occupational duties for sense gratification. Sometimes in religion they say you'll go to heaven. What is that heaven? That is also sense gratification. You'll live so long years, you'll have so many beautiful wives and so many things, so many things. All flowery language. What is the basic? Sense gratification. That's all. This is one way.

**The Path of Renunciation**

Another way is nivṛtti-mārga. When one has seen perfectly that "This process of sense gratification cannot give me actual happiness," then they began to give it up. Just like the Māyāvādī philosophy. They say **brahma-satyaṁ jagan mithyā:** "This world is false." Just like in your country, a section of youngsters, they're disgusted with this materialistic way of life. They have taken to the hippies' path. Why? It does not give satisfaction, but they do not know the right way. They have taken a wrong way, hippies.

**Surrendering to Kṛṣṇa**

So Kṛṣṇa says, "You have to give up all this nonsense accepting and rejecting. You have to take to Me, then you'll be happy." **Sarva-dharmān. Sarva-dharmān** means some religious occupation is for sense gratification and some religious occupation is rejection of this material world. So we have to give up both these, the acceptance and rejection. We have to accept the Kṛṣṇa's path, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "Surrender unto Me." Then we'll be happy.

**The Example of Arjuna**

**Guest:** I'd like to just digress on that. Arjuna had a very difficult problem with whether to go into combat or not. Today...

**Prabhupāda:** Yes. He accepted Kṛṣṇa's, Kṛṣṇa's path, surrender. Kṛṣṇa wanted that "You must fight." So in the beginning he did not like to fight, but when he surrendered... Kṛṣṇa asked him, "My dear Arjuna, I have spoken to you everything. Now what you are going to do?" Now here also Kṛṣṇa is giving independence to Arjuna: "What you are going to do?" **Yathecchasi tathā kuru** [[Bg. 18.63]]. "Now whatever you like, you do." He never interferes. And what Arjuna said? **Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava:** [[Bg. 18.73]] "Oh, I shall do what You are saying. Yes." [laughter] This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. **Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava.** Yes.

**The Futility of Material Sense Gratification**

**Prabhupāda:** ...mātir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [[SB 7.5.30]].

**The Uncontrolled Senses**

Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram. Adānta means uncontrolled. Our materialistic life means we cannot control our senses and the mind. The mind is dictating that "Enjoy your senses in this way."

**Technical Difficulty**

What is this sound? [feedback]

**Aside**

Stop that sound. Stop that. We don't want it.

**Śyāmasundara:** Turn it off.

**Prabhupāda:** So, materialistic life means sense gratification. This sense gratification process is going on life after life. So many varieties of life means different standards of sense gratification. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has given us full liberty to gratify our senses.

**The Origin of Sense Gratification**

Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga-vāñchā kare [Prema-vivarta]. We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, but we are living entities, and because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we have got all the desires of Kṛṣṇa in small particle. As our existence is a small particle... Just like, try to understand gold and a small particle of gold. So the small particle of gold has got all the qualities of the original gold. Just like sense gratification. Kṛṣṇa has got also propensity for sense gratification. He is the original sense gratifier, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā: bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [[Bg. 5.29]]. Supreme enjoyer. Wherefrom the enjoying spirit of us comes? Because it is there in Kṛṣṇa. Janmādy asya yataḥ [[SB 1.1.1]]. The Vedānta-sūtra says everything is originated from Kṛṣṇa. Para-brahman or the Absolute Truth means where everything is generated. That is Absolute Truth.

**The Perfection of Sense Gratification**

Therefore, our desire for sense gratification is from Kṛṣṇa. Here is the perfect sense gratification, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. The same thing as here: young boys and girls, they try to enjoy senses. But where this propensity comes from? It is coming from Kṛṣṇa. Because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the quality of sense gratification is there; therefore we, being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the quality of sense gratification also there. But the difference is here we are trying to gratify our senses in the material world; therefore we are frustrated. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means that you gratify your senses in association with Kṛṣṇa. Then it is perfect.

**The Analogy of the Finger**

The same example: just like this finger, the finger. There is a nice sweetball or a nice foodstuff. The finger picks it up, but it cannot enjoy. It has to be..., the foodstuff has to be, given to the stomach, and then the finger also can enjoy. Similarly, we cannot gratify our senses directly, but when we join with Kṛṣṇa, when Kṛṣṇa enjoys, then we can enjoy. This is our position. The same example: the finger independently cannot eat anything, cannot enjoy the sweetball, nice sweetballs. The finger can pick it up and put it in the stomach, and the stomach enjoys, the finger enjoys. This is our position.

**The Purification of Sense Gratification**

So we have to purify the propensity of sense gratification, materially. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**The Network of Ignorance**

So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that this body is a network of ignorance, simply sense gratification: "I shall eat this. I shall eat that. I shall hear this. I shall..." The ear is engaged in hearing nice cinema songs, and the tongue is engaged in going to the restaurant, enjoying so many so-called palatable dishes. Similarly, other senses, they are engaged.

**Controlling the Senses**

According to the bhakti-yoga system, the first control is recommended to the tongue. That is said, that "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ" [[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]. Now, we receive knowledge through the indriyas, but if the indriyas are impure—senses are impure—they cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. "Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi." Na, beginning. Because beginning is śravaṇam. Bhakti-mārga begins by hearing. Now, what is śravaṇam? Chanting. If there is chanting or there is some speaking, then we can hear. That is recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that simply hear.

**The Importance of Hearing**

So... But it is said, "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ." These present blunt senses, material senses, cannot receive even this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra. They say, "This is nuisance." Bhagavān says in the Bhagavad-gītā, "catur-vidhā bhajante mām" [[Bg. 9.14]]: "Four classes of men who begin bhagavad bhajana," "sukṛtina," "those who are pious..." But the modern leaders, they say, "This bhajana is nuisance." This is our misfortune. "Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ" [[Bg. 9.14]]. These are the explanations in the Bhagavad-gītā. Saintly person, mahātmā, they are engaged in chanting satatam, always. "Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām" [[Bg. 9.14]]. Kīrtayantaḥ, glorifying.

**Glorifying the Lord**

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, "kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ. Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ" [[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]. This is the recommendation, that you should glorify the holy name of Hari. Hari means Kṛṣṇa. So that is the recommendation. But we are meeting so many obstacles because they think, "This chanting is nuisance. This bhajana is nuisance. This is Kali-yuga. Not the Kali-yuga; even every yuga." So "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ" [[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]. A devotee is hearing, he is enjoying, and the nondevotee is thinking, "It is nuisance." Therefore it is said, "ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ." The blunt senses, material senses, they cannot receive. Nāmādi. Not only name; they cannot see Lord Kṛṣṇa's form. Because hearing and seeing and smelling and tasting and touching... We have got so many senses.

**Purifying the Senses**

So these senses being materially contaminated, it cannot hear what is Kṛṣṇa's holy name. "Ataḥ kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ" [[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]. Then how to understand Kṛṣṇa? That is recommended, "sevonmukhe hi jihvādau." You have to engage your tongue first of all in the service of the Lord. The Kṛṣṇa realization begins from the tongue. How? Now you simply make it a vow, that "I shall not accept anything that is not offered to Kṛṣṇa." And you take another vow, that "I shall not talk anything except glorifying the Lord." Then you become perfect. Very simple method. Simply you have to make this determination, that "I shall not talk anything which is not about Kṛṣṇa, and I shall not eat anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa."

So after the activities of the material senses stopped, then the spiritual senses begin to work. So when from that spiritual senses we derive bliss, that is wanted. That is real **ānanda**.

**The Necessity of Tapasya**

To enjoy the spiritual sense, one has to not only stop, but undergo **tapasya, tapo divyam**. Just like a man is diseased, he wants to eat, but due to the disease he cannot eat. So first of all, you have to cure the disease, then your eating will be a pleasure. And if you want to eat in the diseased condition, then the taste will not be proper; you cannot eat. A man suffering from jaundice, if you give him sugar candy, he will taste it bitter.

And **tapasya** means stops material sense gratification.

**A Conversation with Dr. Movebhed**

[Dr. Movebhed enters the room]

**Dr. Movebhed:** Yes.

**Prabhupāda:** So **Bhagavad-gītā...** Kṛṣṇa is speaking **Bhagavad-gītā**. What is the position of Kṛṣṇa? That you have mentioned?

Similarly, Dr. Radhakrishnan has committed so many mistakes. So big, big scholars, they're trying to study **Bhagavad-gītā**, but they cannot understand.

**The Importance of Surrender**

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, **tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā** [[Bg. 4.34]]. You first prepare yourself to surrender, **praṇipāta, praṇipāta, prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa nipāta**. Without any reservation, surrender, **praṇipātena**, by the surrendering process, and **paripraśnena**, by enquiring from the authority. Because it is not very easy to understand Kṛṣṇa. **Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye** [[Bg. 7.3]]. Out of many, many million persons one try to understand, one trying to become perfect, **siddhaye**. **Siddhi** means perfection. So **yatatām api siddhānām** [[Bg. 7.3]]: "Those who have attained **siddhi**, perfection, out of many such **siddhas**," **kaścid māṁ vetti tattvataḥ**, "maybe one man can understand Me." The first of all to become **siddha**. Then, after becoming **siddha**, one may understand Kṛṣṇa or he may not. Actually, it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. But you can understand Kṛṣṇa if you adopt this process: **praṇipātena, paripraśnena, sevayā**---three things.

So dharma means occupation. People are engaged in various types of occupational duties for sense gratification. Sometimes in religion they say you'll go to heaven. What is that heaven? That is also sense gratification. You'll live so long years, you'll have so many beautiful wives and so many things, so many things. All flowery language. What is the basic? Sense gratification. That's all. This is one way.

**The Path of Renunciation**

Another way is nivṛtti-mārga. When one has seen perfectly that "This process of sense gratification cannot give me actual happiness," then they began to give it up. Just like the Māyāvādī philosophy. They say **brahma-satyaṁ jagan mithyā:** "This world is false." Just like in your country, a section of youngsters, they're disgusted with this materialistic way of life. They have taken to the hippies' path. Why? It does not give satisfaction, but they do not know the right way. They have taken a wrong way, hippies.

**Surrendering to Kṛṣṇa**

So Kṛṣṇa says, "You have to give up all this nonsense accepting and rejecting. You have to take to Me, then you'll be happy." **Sarva-dharmān. Sarva-dharmān** means some religious occupation is for sense gratification and some religious occupation is rejection of this material world. So we have to give up both these, the acceptance and rejection. We have to accept the Kṛṣṇa's path, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "Surrender unto Me." Then we'll be happy.

**The Example of Arjuna**

**Guest:** I'd like to just digress on that. Arjuna had a very difficult problem with whether to go into combat or not. Today...

**Prabhupāda:** Yes. He accepted Kṛṣṇa's, Kṛṣṇa's path, surrender. Kṛṣṇa wanted that "You must fight." So in the beginning he did not like to fight, but when he surrendered... Kṛṣṇa asked him, "My dear Arjuna, I have spoken to you everything. Now what you are going to do?" Now here also Kṛṣṇa is giving independence to Arjuna: "What you are going to do?" **Yathecchasi tathā kuru** [[Bg. 18.63]]. "Now whatever you like, you do." He never interferes. And what Arjuna said? **Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava:** [[Bg. 18.73]] "Oh, I shall do what You are saying. Yes." [laughter] This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. **Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava.** Yes.

**The Futility of Material Sense Gratification**

**Prabhupāda:** ...mātir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [[SB 7.5.30]].

**The Uncontrolled Senses**

Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram. Adānta means uncontrolled. Our materialistic life means we cannot control our senses and the mind. The mind is dictating that "Enjoy your senses in this way."

**Technical Difficulty**

What is this sound? [feedback]

**Aside**

Stop that sound. Stop that. We don't want it.

**Śyāmasundara:** Turn it off.

**Prabhupāda:** So, materialistic life means sense gratification. This sense gratification process is going on life after life. So many varieties of life means different standards of sense gratification. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has given us full liberty to gratify our senses.

**The Origin of Sense Gratification**

Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga-vāñchā kare [Prema-vivarta]. We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, but we are living entities, and because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we have got all the desires of Kṛṣṇa in small particle. As our existence is a small particle... Just like, try to understand gold and a small particle of gold. So the small particle of gold has got all the qualities of the original gold. Just like sense gratification. Kṛṣṇa has got also propensity for sense gratification. He is the original sense gratifier, as it is stated in the Bhagavad-gītā: bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [[Bg. 5.29]]. Supreme enjoyer. Wherefrom the enjoying spirit of us comes? Because it is there in Kṛṣṇa. Janmādy asya yataḥ [[SB 1.1.1]]. The Vedānta-sūtra says everything is originated from Kṛṣṇa. Para-brahman or the Absolute Truth means where everything is generated. That is Absolute Truth.

**The Perfection of Sense Gratification**

Therefore, our desire for sense gratification is from Kṛṣṇa. Here is the perfect sense gratification, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. The same thing as here: young boys and girls, they try to enjoy senses. But where this propensity comes from? It is coming from Kṛṣṇa. Because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the quality of sense gratification is there; therefore we, being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the quality of sense gratification also there. But the difference is here we are trying to gratify our senses in the material world; therefore we are frustrated. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means that you gratify your senses in association with Kṛṣṇa. Then it is perfect.

**The Analogy of the Finger**

The same example: just like this finger, the finger. There is a nice sweetball or a nice foodstuff. The finger picks it up, but it cannot enjoy. It has to be..., the foodstuff has to be, given to the stomach, and then the finger also can enjoy. Similarly, we cannot gratify our senses directly, but when we join with Kṛṣṇa, when Kṛṣṇa enjoys, then we can enjoy. This is our position. The same example: the finger independently cannot eat anything, cannot enjoy the sweetball, nice sweetballs. The finger can pick it up and put it in the stomach, and the stomach enjoys, the finger enjoys. This is our position.

**The Purification of Sense Gratification**

So we have to purify the propensity of sense gratification, materially. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.
