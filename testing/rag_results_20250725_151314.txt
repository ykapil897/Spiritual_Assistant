### Sense Control and Kṛṣṇa Consciousness

**Prabhupāda:** Hmm.

SHLOKA:
**āmayo yaś ca bhūtānāṁ**
**jāyate yena suvrata**
**tad eva hy āmayaṁ dravyaṁ**
**na punāti cikitsitam**
— *SB 1.5.33*

**Key Insight:** This verse is the essence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, highlighting the importance of sense control.

**Prabhupāda:** Is very important verse. Actually, this is the essence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. What is that? People become diseased by sense gratification. Everyone knows. Too much sense gratification means creating disease.

**Key Insight:** Sense gratification leads to disease and suffering.

**Prabhupāda:** For example, some nice eatable. But if you, because it is very nice **rasagullā**, therefore I shall devour one dozen, that's not very good. That will create indigestion immediately.

**Key Insight:** Overindulgence in sense pleasures leads to suffering.

**Prabhupāda:** So in this material world, people are so much enthusiastic in the matter of sense gratification. Whole world---not only now---this is the place for competition of sense gratification. Advancement of civilization means, the so-called civilization, material civ..., means how much you are able to gratify your senses. That is civilization. How much you are given facilities to gratify your senses. This is the modern idea: hedonism. More eat, more drink---eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. Sense gratification.

**Key Insight:** Modern civilization promotes sense gratification as the goal of life.

**Prabhupāda:** This is not only new. Formerly, the **Cārvāka Muni**, he also advocated, **ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā ghṛtaṁ pibet**. In India, they want to eat very nice foodstuff prepared from **ghee**. So he advised that **ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā ghṛtaṁ pibet**: even you have no money, then beg, borrow or steal, get **ghee** and eat very nice.

**Key Insight:** Even ancient philosophers like Cārvāka Muni promoted sense gratification.

**Prabhupāda:** //Ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā,// the word is... Suppose one has no money, then how to get money? Either cheat somebody, beg..., or beg. But begging for **gṛhastha** is not very good thing, but sometimes they do so, beg, borrow or, promising, "Give me now money. I shall pay you." And when credit is lost, then steal, pickpocket. This is as theory.

**Key Insight:** Sense gratification leads to cheating and stealing.

**Prabhupāda:** Similarly, **Cārvāka Muni**, **ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā ghṛtaṁ pibet**, "Never mind." "No, I will have to pay." "No, that we shall see later on, never mind." "No, I will be sinful, I will have to pay next life." This is within the blood of every Indian, that if I cheat you or if I take some money from you without your benefit, without repayment, then I will have to suffer.

**Key Insight:** Indians traditionally believe that cheating and stealing will lead to suffering in the next life.

**Prabhupāda:** Still in India they believe this. There are some incidences that a man... His father took some loan from some gentleman and his father died, and his son came to pay the money to the creditor: "Sir, my father took so much money from you. Now my father died without payment. So I have got money. You kindly take it."

**Key Insight:** The story illustrates the strong sense of moral responsibility in Indian culture.

*Key Insight: True sense control and Kṛṣṇa consciousness come from understanding the consequences of sense gratification and cultivating a higher goal in life.*
