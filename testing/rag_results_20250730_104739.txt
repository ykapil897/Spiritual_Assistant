### 📖 The History of the Bhagavad-gītā

**Prabhupāda:** That is the rough estimate of the history of the Gītā, according to the Gītā itself and according to the version of the speaker, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:** It was spoken to the sun-god because he is also a **kṣatriya** and is the father of all **kṣatriyas** who are descendants of the sun-god, or the **sūrya-vaṁśa kṣatriyas**. Because Bhagavad-gītā is as good as the **Vedas**, being spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this knowledge is known as **apauruṣeya**, superhuman.

**Prabhupāda:** Since the Vedic instructions are accepted as they are, without human interpretation, the Gītā must therefore be accepted without mundane interpretation. The mundane wranglers may speculate on the Gītā in their own way, but that is not Bhagavad-gītā as it is.

**Prabhupāda:** Therefore Bhagavad-gītā has to be accepted as it is, from the disciplic succession, and it is described herein that the Lord spoke to the sun-god, the sun-god spoke to his son Manu, and Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku.

**Prabhupāda:** The people are not able to hear it. People are so impatient that they cannot hear it even.

**Guest:** What are you requesting?

**Prabhupāda:** We are requesting simply by hearing: **sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir** [SB 10.14.3]. If one simply hears, never mind if he remains in his own position—either **gṛhastha**, **sannyāsī** or **brahmācari**, it doesn't matter—just let him hear. But he cannot patiently hear. That is the qualification observed in me by my Guru Mahārāja when he accepted me as **celā**. At that time he recommended that "This boy hears. He does not go away." That was my qualification. And I was also hearing him. I could not follow him—still I was trying to hear. That was my...: "Let me hear." I used to hear his speaking, not to understand. Even I cannot understand what he has spoken—still not—but I used to hear him; therefore he accepted me. Hearing is so important. People cannot even hear, especially. They have become so disturbed, impatient; he cannot hear. It is pinching. The hearing becomes pinching. **Māyā** kicks him, "Get out, get out." [laughter]

### 📖 The Importance of Hearing

**Prabhupāda:** So, yatas tataś copaninye nyāyato 'nyāyato dhanaṁ babhārāsyāḥ kuṭumbinyāḥ kuṭumbaṁ manda-dhīr ayam — *SB 6.1.66*

*Key Insight: Patient hearing is essential for spiritual growth.*
