**Gita Reference:** Bhagavad-gita As It Is, Chapter 9, Text 34; Chapter 18, Text 65-66

**Opening Hook:**
In the modern world, we often find ourselves lost in the pursuit of fleeting pleasures and material success. But what is the ultimate goal of our spiritual pursuits? As Srila Prabhupada so eloquently puts it, "The ultimate goal of all spiritual pursuits is to know the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krsna." (Science of Self Realization 3, Chapter 3, Text 13, Verse) [1]

**Core Teaching:**
Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the source of all incarnations (Krsna Book 2, Chapter 1, Text 11, Purport) [2]. He is the ultimate object of love and devotion, and He is the reservoir of all pleasure (Krsna Book 2, Chapter 1, Text 15, Verse) [3]. Glorifying Krsna is the highest form of spiritual activity, and it is recommended in the scriptures (Teachings of Lord Kapila 2, Chapter 3, Text 23, Purport) [4].

**Frameworks or Levels:**
In our spiritual journey, we often find ourselves oscillating between different levels of consciousness. We may be driven by our material desires, or we may be motivated by a desire for spiritual growth. But the ultimate goal is to transcend these levels and reach the platform of pure devotional service to Krsna.

**Practical Application:**
So, how can we glorify Krsna in our daily lives? Here are a few practical tips:

* Take a few minutes each day to chant the Hare Krsna mantra and reflect on Krsna's divine qualities.

* Engage in devotional activities such as singing, dancing, or cooking for Krsna.
* Share your knowledge of Krsna with others and inspire them to glorify Him as well.

**Micro-practice:**
Take a few deep breaths and repeat the following mantra to yourself: "Krsna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and He is the source of all incarnations." As you repeat this mantra, reflect on Krsna's divine qualities and try to connect with Him on a deeper level.

**Closing Reflection:**
By glorifying Krsna, we can attain spiritual liberation and make our lives successful (Science of Self Realization 3, Chapter 3, Text 17, Purport) [5]. As Srila Prabhupada so beautifully puts it, "By glorifying the Lord, one can attain spiritual liberation, and thus one's life becomes successful."
