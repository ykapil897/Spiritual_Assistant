TRANSLATION: I have studied the path of understanding self-knowledge from my spiritual master, the Personality of Godhead, and thus after circumambulating Him I have come to this place, very much aggrieved due to separation.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Śrī Uddhava's actual life is the direct symbol of the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// enunciated first to Brahmājī by the Personality of Godhead [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]. These four very great and important verses from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are particularly taken out by the Māyāvādī speculators, who construe a different purport to suit their impersonal view of monism. Here is the proper answer to such unauthorized speculators. The verses of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// are purely theistic science understandable by the postgraduate students of //Bhagavad-gītā,// The unauthorized dry speculators are offenders at the lotus feet of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa because they distort the purports of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to mislead the public and prepare a direct path to the hell known as Andha-tāmisra. As confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:16:20|(Bg. 16.20)]] such envious speculators are without knowledge and are surely condemned life after life. They unnecessarily take shelter of Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya, but he was not so drastic as to commit an offense at the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa. According to Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya preached the Māyāvāda philosophy for a particular purpose. Such a philosophy was necessary to defeat the Buddhist philosophy of the nonexistence of the spirit soul, but it was never meant for perpetual acceptance. It was an emergency. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa was accepted by Śaṅkarācārya as the Supreme Personality of Godhead in his commentation on //Bhagavad-gītā.// Since he was a great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he did not dare write any commentary on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because that would have been a direct offense at the lotus feet of the Lord. But later speculators, in the name of Māyāvāda philosophy, unnecessarily make their commentary on the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36] without any bona fide intent.

The monistic dry speculators have no business in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because this particular Vedic literature is forbidden for them by the great author himself. Śrīla Vyāsadeva has definitely forbidden persons engaged in religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, finally, salvation, from trying to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// which is not meant for them [[books:sb:1:1:2|(SB 1.1.2)]]. Śrīpāda Śrīdhara Svāmī, the great commentator on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// has definitely forbidden the salvationists or monists to deal in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is not for them. Yet such unauthorized persons perversely try to understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and thus they commit offenses at the feet of the Lord, which even Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya dared not do. Thus they prepare for their continuation of miserable life. It should be particularly noted herein that Uddhava studied the //catuḥ-ślokī Bhāgavatam// [//SB// 2.9.33/34/35/36]  directly from the Lord, who spoke them first to Brahmājī, and this time the Lord explained more confidentially the self-knowledge mentioned as the //paramāṁ sthitim.// Upon learning such self-knowledge of love, Uddhava felt very much aggrieved by feelings of separation from the Lord. Unless one is awakened to the stage of Uddhava---everlastingly feeling the separation of the Lord in transcendental love, as exhibited by Lord Caitanya also---one cannot understand the real import of the four essential verses of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// One should not indulge in the unauthorized act of twisting the meaning and thereby putting himself on the dangerous path of offense.

REFERENCE: SB 5.15.1 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued: The son of Mahārāja Bharata known as Sumati followed the path of Ṛṣabhadeva, but some unscrupulous people imagined him to be Lord Buddha himself. These people, who were actually atheistic and of bad character, took up the Vedic principles in an imaginary, infamous way to support their activities. Thus these sinful people accepted Sumati as Lord Buddhadeva and propagated the theory that everyone should follow the principles of Sumati. In this way they were carried away by mental concoction.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Those who are Āryans strictly follow the Vedic principles, but in this age of Kali a community has sprung up known as the //ārya-samāja,// which is ignorant of the import of the //Vedas// in the //paramparā// system. Their leaders decry all bona fide //ācāryas,// and they pose themselves as the real followers of the Vedic principles. These //ācāryas// who do not follow the Vedic principles are presently known as the //ārya-samājas,// or the Jains. Not only do they not follow the Vedic principles, but they have no relationship with Lord Buddha. Imitating the behavior of Sumati, they claim to be the descendants of Ṛṣabhadeva. Those who are Vaiṣṇavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the //Vedas.// In //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:15:15|(Bg. 15.15)]] Kṛṣṇa says, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ:// "The real purpose of the //Vedas// is to understand Me." This is the injunction of all Vedic literatures. One who does not know the greatness of Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot be accepted as an Āryan. Lord Buddha, an incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, adopted a particular means to propagate the philosophy of //bhāgavata-dharma.// He preached almost exclusively among atheists. Atheists do not want any God, and Lord Buddha therefore said that there is no God, but he adopted the means to instruct his followers for their benefit. Therefore he preached in a duplicitous way, saying that there is no God. Nonetheless, he himself was an incarnation of God.

REFERENCE: SB 3.19.37 (Srimad Bhagavatam)



TRANSLATION: O brāhmaṇas, anyone who hears, chants, or takes pleasure in the wonderful narration of the killing of the Hiraṇyākṣa demon by the Lord, who appeared as the first boar in order to deliver the world, is at once relieved of the results of sinful activities, even the killing of a brāhmaṇa.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: Since the Personality of Godhead is in the absolute position, there is no difference between His pastimes and His personality. Anyone who hears about the pastimes of the Lord associates with the Lord directly, and one who associates directly with the Lord is certainly freed from all sinful activities, even to the extent of the killing of a //brāhmaṇa,// which is considered the most sinful activity in the material world. One should be very eager to hear about the activities of the Lord from the bona fide source, the pure devotee. If one simply gives aural reception to the narration and accepts the glories of the Lord, then he is qualified. The impersonalist philosophers cannot understand the activities of the Lord. They think that all His activities are //māyā;// therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. Since everything to them is //māyā,// these narrations are not for them. Some impersonalists are reluctant to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// although many of them are now taking an interest in it just for monetary gain. Actually, however, they have no faith. On the contrary, they describe it in their own way. We should not hear, therefore, from the Māyāvādīs. We have to hear from Sūta Gosvāmī or Maitreya, who actually present the narrations as they are, and only then can we relish the pastimes of the Lord; otherwise the effects on the neophyte audience will be poisonous.

5️⃣ FINAL ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: The Spotless Purāṇa**

**The Offenders at the Lotus Feet of Kṛṣṇa**

**Text 1: The Māyāvādīs, Impersonalists, and Their Offenses**

"Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya" (SB 1.1.1) - Let us offer our obeisances to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva.

In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śrīla Prabhupāda reveals the nature of the Māyāvādīs, or impersonalists, who commit offenses at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. These offenders, as described in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.4.20, Purport, "distort the purports of Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam to mislead the public and prepare a direct path to the hell known as Andha-tāmisra." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/4/20.txt)

**Text 2: The Māyāvādīs and Self-Realization**

The Māyāvādīs, despite their claims, are not counted among the siddhas, those who have realized the self. As Śrīla Prabhupāda explains in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.4.20, Purport, "Unless one is awakened to the stage of Uddhava---everlastingly feeling the separation of the Lord in transcendental love, as exhibited by Lord Caitanya also---one cannot understand the real import of the four essential verses of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/4/20.txt)

**Text 3: The Māyāvādīs and Lord Buddha**

Furthermore, the Māyāvādīs have no relationship with Lord Buddha, and they are ignorant of the path of the Vedas. As stated in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.15.1, Purport, "Those who are Vaiṣṇavas carefully avoid their company because they are ignorant of the path of the Vedas." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/5/15/1.txt)

**Text 4: The Danger of Hearing from Māyāvādīs**

One should not hear about the activities of the Lord from the Māyāvādīs, as they have no faith and describe the narrations in their own way. Śrīla Prabhupāda warns us in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.19.37, Purport, "We should not hear, therefore, from the Māyāvādīs. We have to hear from Sūta Gosvāmī or Maitreya, who actually present the narrations as they are, and only then can we relish the pastimes of the Lord; otherwise the effects on the neophyte audience will be poisonous." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/3/19/37.txt)

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, the Māyāvādīs, or impersonalists, are offenders at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and their teachings are detrimental to spiritual progress. As neophyte devotees, we should be cautious not to associate with them or hear from them, lest we fall prey to their misconceptions. Instead, we should seek guidance from authorized spiritual masters, such as Śrīla Prabhupāda, who present the teachings of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in their pure and unadulterated form.

**Practical Application**

Let us take heed of Śrīla Prabhupāda's warnings and avoid the company of Māyāvādīs. Instead, let us seek out the association of devotees who are faithful to the teachings of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and the instructions of the spiritual master. By doing so, we can ensure our spiritual progress and avoid the pitfalls of impersonalism.
