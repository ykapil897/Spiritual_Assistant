REFERENCE: SB 9.5.6 (Srimad Bhagavatam)

VERSE: 

TRANSLATION: O Sudarśana, you have a very auspicious hub, and therefore you are the upholder of all religion. You are just like an inauspicious comet for the irreligious demons. Indeed, you are the maintainer of the three worlds, you are full of transcendental effulgence, you are as quick as the mind, and you are able to work wonders. I can simply utter the word namaḥ, offering all obeisances unto you.

PURPORT BY SRILA PRABHUPADA: The disc of the Lord is called Sudarśana because he does not discriminate between high and low criminals or demons. Durvāsā Muni was certainly a powerful //brāhmaṇa,// but his acts against the pure devotee Mahārāja Ambarīṣa were no better than the activities of //asuras.// As stated in the //śāstras, dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam:// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]] the word //dharma// refers to the orders or laws given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]] real //dharma// is surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore real //dharma// means //bhakti,// or devotional service to the Lord. The Sudarśana //cakra// is here addressed as //dharma-setave,// the protector of //dharma.// Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was a truly religious person, and consequently for his protection the Sudarśana //cakra// was ready to punish even such a strict //brāhmaṇa// as Durvāsā Muni because he had acted like a demon. There are demons even in the form of //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore the Sudarśana //cakra// does not discriminate between //brāhmaṇa// demons and //śūdra// demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is called a demon. In the //śāstras// we find many //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// who acted as demons and have been described as demons. According to the verdict of the //śāstras,// one has to be understood according to his symptoms. If one is born of a //brāhmaṇa// father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon. The Sudarśana //cakra// is always concerned with annihilating the demons. Therefore he is described as //adharma-śīlāsura-dhūma-ketave.// Those who are not devotees are called //adharma-śīla.// The Sudarśana //cakra// is just like an inauspicious comet for all such demons.

**Invocation**

om tat sat bhuvanesvari sarva-bhuta-sthā

**The Protector of Dharma**

In the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, 9.5.6, we find a most illuminating description of the Sudarśana cakra, the divine disc of the Supreme Lord. Srila Prabhupada explains, "The Sudarśana cakra is here addressed as dharma-setave, the protector of dharma." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/9/5/6.txt)

**Real Dharma: Surrender to the Supreme**

But what is this dharma that the Sudarśana cakra protects? Srila Prabhupada clarifies, "Real dharma means bhakti, or devotional service to the Lord." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/9/5/6.txt) This surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essence of true dharma.

**No Discrimination**

The Sudarśana cakra, as the protector of dharma, does not discriminate between brāhmaṇa demons and śūdra demons. Srila Prabhupada states, "The Sudarśana cakra does not discriminate between brāhmaṇa demons and śūdra demons. Anyone against the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotees is called a demon." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/9/5/6.txt)

**Symptoms, Not Birth, Determine Demonhood**

Furthermore, Srila Prabhupada teaches us that one's symptoms, not birth, determine whether they are a demon or not. He quotes the śāstras, "According to the verdict of the śāstras, one has to be understood according to his symptoms. If one is born of a brāhmaṇa father but his symptoms are demoniac, he is regarded as a demon." [Source](https://github.com/iskconpress/books/tree/master/sb/9/5/6.txt)

**Practical Application**

In conclusion, let us reflect on the significance of the Sudarśana cakra as the protector of dharma and the importance of surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. May we strive to cultivate the symptoms of a devotee, rather than those of a demon, and thus earn the protection of the Sudarśana cakra.
